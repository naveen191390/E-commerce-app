1
00:00:31,184 --> 00:00:32,539
Sir,

2
00:00:32,563 --> 00:00:33,917
Hey, hey.

3
00:00:34,756 --> 00:00:37,890
Why did you stop this car here?

4
00:00:37,915 --> 00:00:41,140
You cannot stop this car here, sir.

5
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:44,534
This is a position for basketball crew.

6
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,124
I am a basketball coach.

7
00:00:50,494 --> 00:00:52,847
O master "smart".

8
00:01:27,436 --> 00:01:31,123
- What?
Are you really a basketball coach?

9
00:01:33,025 --> 00:01:36,005
- Yes.
- So show me how to pay this basket.

10
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:42,681
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

11
00:01:42,832 --> 00:01:44,632
- Good luck.
- And you, too.

12
00:01:44,744 --> 00:01:47,218
- Good luck.
- And you too, sir.

13
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:48,899
Good morning.

14
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:01,629
Is this the time of coming?

15
00:02:02,277 --> 00:02:04,477
The oldest coach came early and

16
00:02:04,502 --> 00:02:06,190
sat here, and the assistant comes.

17
00:02:06,215 --> 00:02:08,825
What do you want if you want
to come at seven in the morning?

18
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:58,404
Sir, did your wife come this time?

19
00:02:59,031 --> 00:03:01,438
It is busy.

20
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,403
Watch the players a man for a man.

21
00:03:20,954 --> 00:03:21,954
Wait a minute.

22
00:03:26,723 --> 00:03:28,890
Pass the ball to Dave,
pass the ball to Dave.

23
00:03:28,915 --> 00:03:32,574
- Sidhath, passed the ball to Dave. How does
it pass it and Dave is not at its level?

24
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,700
Look at this.

25
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:42,608
- Pass the ball to Dave again.
- Golshan, this is enough.

26
00:03:43,206 --> 00:03:44,926
Come, count.

27
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,141
Pass, pass.

28
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:59,266
- Your strategy is wrong, sir, if you listen to me...
- Be quiet.

29
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:01,033
Go and sit there.

30
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,424
Faster, pass the ball.

31
00:04:07,071 --> 00:04:08,931
Come on, come.

32
00:04:08,956 --> 00:04:12,553
Come on Dave, hit.

33
00:04:18,172 --> 00:04:20,166
- How did Ravan died, my brother?
- What sir?

34
00:04:21,274 --> 00:04:22,934
How did Raven die?

35
00:04:23,409 --> 00:04:25,715
- I don't know, sir.
- Vichan said...

36
00:04:25,752 --> 00:04:29,398
- "Oh Brabho, instill the weapon in his Sareeh directly."
- Pay attention, guys.

37
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:32,409
- Pay attention.
- The gods listen to everyone.

38
00:04:32,447 --> 00:04:34,593
- Yes, sir.
- However, this is just a human being.

39
00:04:34,618 --> 00:04:37,578
- Pay attention, guys. He is also
from the Delhi region and its environs.

40
00:04:39,305 --> 00:04:41,038
Hurry up, return, return.

41
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:49,145
The problem is over, the game ended.

42
00:04:49,635 --> 00:04:51,078
The game ended in dropping the ball.

43
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,179
Be quiet.

44
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,954
Keep a beginner coach as you are.

45
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:06,478
Let the older coach coach as an old coach.

46
00:05:06,503 --> 00:05:08,724
- You want to take my place, right?
- Yes, I want it.

47
00:05:08,749 --> 00:05:11,269
- You want to be the main coach, right?
- Yes, yes, I want that.

48
00:05:15,327 --> 00:05:17,981
He paid in that basket and show me, dwarf.

49
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:25,132
Sir, sir.

50
00:05:42,686 --> 00:05:43,840
I am strange to my face.

51
00:05:46,023 --> 00:05:47,050
I am strange to my face.

52
00:06:17,387 --> 00:06:20,468
In the International Basketball
Championship that was held in Delhi today...

53
00:06:20,492 --> 00:06:23,230
We also saw a simple fight.

54
00:06:23,275 --> 00:06:26,937
Because of his insult to his
short stature, the assistant...

55
00:07:11,516 --> 00:07:13,196
Do you lead while you are drunk, you fool?

56
00:07:18,143 --> 00:07:20,543
To stop.

57
00:07:22,466 --> 00:07:25,765
Stop, if I hold you, I will cut you off.

58
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,693
To stop.

59
00:07:32,361 --> 00:07:35,134
To stop.

60
00:07:42,968 --> 00:07:46,602
Are you crazy, fool?
I was shocked twice.

61
00:07:47,985 --> 00:07:49,152
What is there, brother?

62
00:07:50,364 --> 00:07:52,138
Is this a suitable
place to stop the car?

63
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:54,519
Show me your license.

64
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,110
Don't you know how to
lead? Show me your license.

65
00:08:26,438 --> 00:08:29,625
Sir, he has no old records.

66
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,450
He is a good man, sir.

67
00:08:32,016 --> 00:08:33,790
Who among us does not make mistakes, sir?

68
00:08:33,815 --> 00:08:36,531
The case is now definitely registered.

69
00:08:36,556 --> 00:08:38,715
You will have to go to
court, so he fell and left.

70
00:08:39,702 --> 00:08:42,709
So, Master, the drunk, is
it awake from your secret?

71
00:08:43,031 --> 00:08:44,698
Come on, brother, fall here.

72
00:08:49,035 --> 00:08:52,242
- What dilemma did you put yourself in my brother?
- Do you not have any shame?

73
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:55,139
Didn't you even think about your mother?

74
00:08:56,051 --> 00:08:58,371
Didn't I be able to save you last night?
- I am sorry, man.

75
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,453
Why do I apologize, you fool?

76
00:09:00,728 --> 00:09:02,848
Am I the one who told you
to lead while you are drunk?

77
00:09:03,058 --> 00:09:04,925
Listen, brother, the
court session tomorrow.

78
00:09:05,355 --> 00:09:06,995
Do not say any nonsense before the judge.

79
00:09:09,505 --> 00:09:12,585
The heart must be great,
sir, but I have forgiven him.

80
00:09:12,729 --> 00:09:14,462
Let him forgive me too.

81
00:09:14,966 --> 00:09:17,839
Sir, these things are very normal.

82
00:09:17,864 --> 00:09:18,981
Let's forget the matter.

83
00:09:20,235 --> 00:09:22,930
Above all, when you are one
family, such things happen, isn't it sir?

84
00:09:22,954 --> 00:09:24,326
He also did not harm.

85
00:09:24,608 --> 00:09:27,288
If he lost his eye, or his
ear split, or he became

86
00:09:27,313 --> 00:09:29,780
deaf, I would have left my
job myself, but in this case...

87
00:09:30,168 --> 00:09:32,481
It is just a simple
scratch, sir, that's all.

88
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:34,865
Ya Paswan G, he would
have made a police report.

89
00:09:35,182 --> 00:09:37,935
- He agreed after a great persuasion.
- He agreed, right?

90
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,628
So it is fine, sir.

91
00:09:40,028 --> 00:09:42,661
Oh Araora G, you are
very good as a coach.

92
00:09:42,966 --> 00:09:46,128
For this reason I have
endured all this yet, but I can not.

93
00:09:46,643 --> 00:09:49,636
You will stop working for some time.

94
00:09:49,661 --> 00:09:51,860
- You have been stopped.
- What?

95
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,590
I?

96
00:09:54,948 --> 00:09:56,228
I was stopped from work?

97
00:09:58,657 --> 00:10:00,857
I can't believe, this is great.

98
00:10:01,455 --> 00:10:05,137
A wound to the back is
better than going to prison.

99
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,746
I only drank this fate, man.

100
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,896
I will do my best to save you from prison.

101
00:10:12,067 --> 00:10:16,621
- I will make you do a community service.
- Well, what is this?

102
00:10:17,603 --> 00:10:21,716
These days, not everyone
is sent to prison in all cases.

103
00:10:21,873 --> 00:10:25,039
Some are sent to do
community service as well.

104
00:10:25,064 --> 00:10:26,240
Good.

105
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:30,002
She looks beautiful when she
wears this tie, looks respectable.

106
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:34,578
Your case went to the most hatred judge.

107
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,568
So do not say any nonsense at all.

108
00:10:37,593 --> 00:10:40,021
- I will say what to say and what should not be said, stay silent.
- Well, well.

109
00:10:40,045 --> 00:10:42,318
Sir, I will not come
with the elevator... I...

110
00:10:42,343 --> 00:10:43,960
- I will use stairs.
- Did not?

111
00:10:44,021 --> 00:10:45,596
No, no, I cannot come with the elevator.

112
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,341
- Golshan, we will delay, come quickly.
- What floor?

113
00:10:48,366 --> 00:10:50,174
The third floor.
- Well, well.

114
00:10:50,218 --> 00:10:52,294
Golshan Aroura, Ibn Harman Arora.

115
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:56,770
Although you are a responsible citizen in society,
you have led your car under the influence of alcohol.

116
00:10:56,794 --> 00:11:01,486
You broke the rear lamp of
government vehicle No. DL 761232.

117
00:11:01,511 --> 00:11:04,712
She quarreled with the
policeman Hattaram.

118
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:08,609
I sang songs against the
law and the constitution?

119
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:12,866
Yes, Madam, he sang a
song called "Blind Law".

120
00:11:12,891 --> 00:11:14,960
This is mentioned in the police statement.

121
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:19,123
Did you know that you may
face a two -year prison sentence?

122
00:11:19,148 --> 00:11:22,393
Two years? Madam, does the punishment
reach this limit for something like this?

123
00:11:24,446 --> 00:11:26,626
Sorry, sir, sorry, madam.

124
00:11:29,117 --> 00:11:33,603
Because of your clean record and being your first
crime, this court does not want to send you to prison.

125
00:11:35,357 --> 00:11:37,611
Do you know what is the community service?

126
00:11:37,636 --> 00:11:38,710
Yes, madam.

127
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:41,812
Do you know about people
with mental disabilities?

128
00:11:41,971 --> 00:11:43,051
About crazy?

129
00:11:44,923 --> 00:11:46,883
Those with mental disabilities!

130
00:11:46,908 --> 00:11:53,608
This means that the mental and physical development of people with
a failure in mental development is different from ordinary people.

131
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:58,341
Use the correct words
when talking about them.

132
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,883
So, Golshan Aroura...

133
00:12:03,908 --> 00:12:06,947
Ibn Harnam Aroura, all the
charges against you have been proven.

134
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:10,470
But the court wants to direct
your talent to the right place.

135
00:12:10,495 --> 00:12:14,871
The court recommends that you
train for a period of three months for a

136
00:12:14,896 --> 00:12:17,757
basketball team with intellectual disabilities - to train them.
- Three months?

137
00:12:17,781 --> 00:12:20,263
My lady, should I study
crazy for three months?

138
00:12:20,288 --> 00:12:22,176
- And a fine of 500 rupees.
- 500 rupees?

139
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:24,149
- To say crazy?
- 1000 rupees.

140
00:12:24,174 --> 00:12:26,242
- Everyone calls them
crazy. 2000 rupees.

141
00:12:26,444 --> 00:12:27,831
What is the mistake
in the words of crazy?

142
00:12:27,855 --> 00:12:28,855
5000 rupees.

143
00:12:32,517 --> 00:12:34,830
A fine of 5000 rupees
imposed on you.

144
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:36,643
- What a donkey.
- What is this?

145
00:12:36,747 --> 00:12:40,987
Can I call crazy crazy? Don't say that,
why do you say anything to anyone?

146
00:12:41,297 --> 00:12:43,771
Am I the only one who
says that? Everyone says.

147
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,090
What is wrong with that?
What has just happened?

148
00:12:46,226 --> 00:12:47,620
Do not say black black.

149
00:12:47,645 --> 00:12:50,193
Don't say to Chinese Chinese,
do not say the crazy crazy.

150
00:12:50,218 --> 00:12:51,839
Do not say a dwarf.

151
00:12:52,187 --> 00:12:53,187
What do I say then?

152
00:12:54,593 --> 00:12:55,800
Wait a minute.

153
00:12:55,825 --> 00:12:58,935
Nobody is a 5 -foot and 8 -inch dwarf.

154
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,680
But it is also considered 5 feet and 6 inches long, and for
this reason you say that you are taller in two descendants?

155
00:13:04,037 --> 00:13:05,143
My mom!

156
00:13:05,565 --> 00:13:08,085
Who is joking with his family?
We do this with strangers.

157
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,738
Why is anyone considered strange?

158
00:13:11,252 --> 00:13:12,886
There are no strangers, son.

159
00:13:13,094 --> 00:13:15,021
Everyone is people.

160
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,898
Is she your son's wife?
- Yes.

161
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,087
Answer, there may be
a problem with the store.

162
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,052
I don't want to talk.

163
00:13:28,738 --> 00:13:31,525
Your pride will destroy your home.

164
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,773
Do not worry about me.

165
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:35,973
I do not worry about it,
but I worry about myself.

166
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:40,463
He left his house and lives in
the external room in my home,

167
00:13:40,488 --> 00:13:43,379
I was getting a rent of
10,000 per month from it.

168
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,343
Is it not it Dalaat G?

169
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:49,493
Ten thousand five hundred. Look,
say ten thousand five hundred.

170
00:13:49,518 --> 00:13:52,854
Who asked you? Take care of
your work and do not interfere.

171
00:13:53,034 --> 00:13:56,346
Go and bring some tea. My
mom, I will give you your rent.

172
00:13:56,485 --> 00:13:59,050
- That's it.
Do not bark like a dog.

173
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,460
Barking bark...

174
00:14:02,844 --> 00:14:04,870
Hey Dalaat G, prepare for me tea as well.

175
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,893
How much, brother...

176
00:14:23,993 --> 00:14:27,946
What can be better than the coming of a
professional coach like you to teach children?

177
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,507
Because other sports
cause them some problems.

178
00:14:31,532 --> 00:14:33,462
They cannot do many things together.

179
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:35,339
They cannot remember much of the rules.

180
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:36,974
Basketball is a little easier.

181
00:14:37,245 --> 00:14:39,285
On them just take the
ball and put it in the basket.

182
00:14:40,494 --> 00:14:42,634
She won medals in other sports as well.

183
00:14:43,021 --> 00:14:45,474
All of these are from
slow bicycle race... this.

184
00:14:45,925 --> 00:14:47,931
And those certificates
from the Kerem game.

185
00:14:48,892 --> 00:14:51,860
I will show you the prizes that you won
in the "Antakshiri" singing competition.

186
00:14:51,884 --> 00:14:53,107
Good, good.

187
00:14:55,244 --> 00:14:57,344
So, how many days a week will come?

188
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,940
One day.

189
00:15:03,332 --> 00:15:06,939
One day a week is more than
enough, it is not good to get the children.

190
00:15:07,685 --> 00:15:08,685
One day?

191
00:15:10,004 --> 00:15:11,962
If so, I will talk to Anu.

192
00:15:12,284 --> 00:15:13,110
Anu?

193
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,385
The one that knows
you, is what sent you here.

194
00:15:16,807 --> 00:15:19,753
- Who is Anu?
- Her nephew here too.

195
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:22,345
- What do you do?
- Judge.

196
00:15:23,007 --> 00:15:25,454
My daughter Anu,
Mr. Golshan came here.

197
00:15:25,602 --> 00:15:26,855
He is a very good man.

198
00:15:27,004 --> 00:15:28,737
He says he will come one day a week.

199
00:15:34,052 --> 00:15:35,052
Welcome.

200
00:15:37,933 --> 00:15:39,899
No, not my lady, there
must be a misunderstanding.

201
00:15:40,675 --> 00:15:44,332
Not one day a week, but
every day a week, Carter Baji.

202
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:49,632
No, no, not the problem of
my lady, this is completely true.

203
00:15:54,033 --> 00:15:56,632
Carter Bage is very nice, very good.

204
00:15:59,267 --> 00:16:00,499
Well, my lady, goodbye.

205
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,799
We are about to hold a national
championship for distinguished people.

206
00:16:07,498 --> 00:16:09,742
Now that you are our coach,
we have made a request.

207
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:13,075
National championship
...people will laugh.

208
00:16:13,426 --> 00:16:14,592
Don't tell anyone about this.

209
00:16:21,367 --> 00:16:25,239
I did not tell anyone that
you were punished here.

210
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:29,932
I could have escaped punishment.

211
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:32,999
I have three lawyers in
my house, do you know?

212
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,706
When I heard about children,
I felt some compassion.

213
00:16:35,967 --> 00:16:37,799
I mean, they are also human, right?

214
00:16:38,633 --> 00:16:41,666
I thought that if I went and did
something, it would be good for them.

215
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:44,466
They will learn something, the poor.

216
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,820
Poor.

217
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:09,332
My name Golshan Aroura.

218
00:17:11,348 --> 00:17:16,142
For the next three
months, I am your coach.

219
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:21,766
I know that it is difficult for you to
understand what is said to you...

220
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,482
So, if you don't
understand anything...

221
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,132
Raise your hands and
say: "Please explain", well?

222
00:17:35,134 --> 00:17:36,134
What?

223
00:17:39,233 --> 00:17:40,532
I don't hear what he says.

224
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:42,958
First, say: "Please explain.

225
00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:47,458
- "Please explain."
- Raise your hand...

226
00:17:51,462 --> 00:17:52,836
"Please explain.

227
00:17:53,231 --> 00:17:56,709
Nothing, he says the
new coach is a donkey.

228
00:18:06,033 --> 00:18:07,366
Well, say your names.

229
00:18:08,328 --> 00:18:09,328
Generous...

230
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:11,168
- Satper.
- Lotus.

231
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:12,658
Lotus? Is your name Lotus?

232
00:18:12,733 --> 00:18:13,969
Kamal Sir.

233
00:18:14,105 --> 00:18:16,042
But he wants to be English.

234
00:18:16,067 --> 00:18:18,699
So we call him Lotus
as a matter of love.

235
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,660
I Godo, and this Panto.

236
00:18:23,933 --> 00:18:24,933
Sunil.

237
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:26,899
Hargovind.

238
00:18:27,026 --> 00:18:28,052
Raju.

239
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,332
"Please explain.

240
00:18:32,568 --> 00:18:33,982
Sharma G.

241
00:18:34,243 --> 00:18:35,437
Sharma G.

242
00:18:39,267 --> 00:18:40,832
So well, let's start training.

243
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:44,366
Quraishi...
- What?

244
00:18:44,525 --> 00:18:46,367
He just finished
saying his name.

245
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:47,704
Karim Quraishi.

246
00:18:51,272 --> 00:18:53,271
Well, now...

247
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:57,366
Let's start with simple exercises
that you can even do, well?

248
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,599
Let's start passing the ball.

249
00:19:03,097 --> 00:19:04,804
Sorry, sorry.

250
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,072
Perhaps passing the
ball is not that easy.

251
00:19:41,366 --> 00:19:44,998
Do something, divide into
husbands... Choose someone.

252
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,000
Sir, I have a sweetheart
from the beginning.

253
00:19:47,467 --> 00:19:49,966
- if? How can I be
with someone else?

254
00:19:49,991 --> 00:19:52,570
His girlfriend is a hay seam.

255
00:19:52,907 --> 00:19:55,673
Yes, then? A passion for
fancy can have a lover, right?

256
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:57,599
Do not say that word.

257
00:19:57,948 --> 00:19:58,948
Which word?

258
00:19:59,146 --> 00:20:01,175
- "Hui Seller".
- So why do you say it?

259
00:20:01,914 --> 00:20:02,932
I just explain.

260
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:04,957
So I was also explaining.

261
00:20:05,097 --> 00:20:07,344
His girlfriend is a hay seam.

262
00:20:07,646 --> 00:20:09,612
I told you not that word,
say something else.

263
00:20:09,637 --> 00:20:10,637
What?

264
00:20:12,176 --> 00:20:15,308
Say it works in the
field of "business".

265
00:20:15,489 --> 00:20:16,788
Business lady, well?

266
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,276
Do you also have a sweetheart?

267
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,332
I have a wife.

268
00:20:22,776 --> 00:20:23,775
What do you do?

269
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,092
She works in the
field of "business".

270
00:20:25,116 --> 00:20:26,908
Me too.

271
00:20:33,264 --> 00:20:34,344
You are the two, come here.

272
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,400
Take a ball.

273
00:20:39,675 --> 00:20:41,299
Take one ball.

274
00:20:41,767 --> 00:20:44,266
I, I...

275
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,856
No, no, close your mouths.

276
00:20:51,241 --> 00:20:52,934
- What is it?
- He went.

277
00:20:54,133 --> 00:20:55,775
- Where did he go?
- He lost his way.

278
00:20:55,995 --> 00:20:57,994
He will return shortly.

279
00:20:58,186 --> 00:20:59,985
Wait a little.

280
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,426
Sir, you have come
back, you can talk now.

281
00:21:26,173 --> 00:21:28,272
Why do you wear
...leather shoes?

282
00:21:28,297 --> 00:21:31,999
- Because it fits my helmet.
Next time, wear a sneakers.

283
00:21:32,229 --> 00:21:34,149
- Also, you will not need a helmet.
- Truly?

284
00:21:34,174 --> 00:21:35,781
That fan is above,

285
00:21:35,806 --> 00:21:38,101
What if I fell to my head?

286
00:21:39,472 --> 00:21:42,942
Hug me, you must embrace me.

287
00:21:44,457 --> 00:21:46,389
Get away, what to do? Get away.

288
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,440
Go back.

289
00:21:51,786 --> 00:21:53,620
Come on, they were
divided into pairs, two two.

290
00:21:53,644 --> 00:21:55,043
Sir, I have a sweetheart
from the beginning.

291
00:21:55,067 --> 00:21:56,942
His girlfriend is a hay seam.

292
00:21:56,967 --> 00:21:59,399
Do not be divided into anything.

293
00:21:59,733 --> 00:22:02,432
Go back to your
places, lined up, let's go.

294
00:22:03,233 --> 00:22:04,913
Nobody says anything,
they remained silent.

295
00:22:19,067 --> 00:22:20,067
Now, hold the balls.

296
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,666
These poor people?

297
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,299
These are terrorists.

298
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:29,712
Who sympathizes with them?

299
00:22:29,883 --> 00:22:31,410
When did you say they are poor?

300
00:22:31,713 --> 00:22:34,155
- You are the one who said that.
- Yes, so how can I form a team?

301
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:35,678
The team consists
of ordinary people.

302
00:22:37,441 --> 00:22:38,674
Coach, tell me something.

303
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:42,266
When you were eight years
old, were you normal or different?

304
00:22:43,184 --> 00:22:44,184
I was normal.

305
00:22:44,307 --> 00:22:49,238
So, doctors say their ability to learn
is at the level of a 8-10-year-old child.

306
00:22:49,755 --> 00:22:52,675
At that age, this happens, one
cannot become conservative, right?

307
00:22:52,707 --> 00:22:55,867
Yes, but staying at the age of 8-10 years
is not always an ordinary matter, man?

308
00:22:57,533 --> 00:23:01,499
Coach, tell me what is this?

309
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,672
This, this... tell
me what it is.

310
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,999
Say, please tell
me what is this.

311
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,500
It is part of the body.

312
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:13,274
My body or your body?

313
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:17,032
Everyone has.

314
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,808
Yes, now I understand
this is normal.

315
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:25,808
I understand that this is normal, and then you will
understand that every person has their own nature.

316
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:30,072
Just as it is normal for the
policeman to hit the thieves.

317
00:23:30,467 --> 00:23:32,406
It is also natural for the
thief to receive beating.

318
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,236
And as it is natural
for the politician to lie.

319
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,093
As is natural for the
public, they discover lying.

320
00:23:36,117 --> 00:23:38,451
Or, as it is normal
for the beggar to beg.

321
00:23:38,633 --> 00:23:41,166
And as it is normal
for the rich to boast.

322
00:23:42,633 --> 00:23:45,466
Everyone adheres to
its own nature, coach.

323
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,799
Your nature is for you,
and their nature for them.

324
00:23:51,733 --> 00:23:52,799
How much sugar you need?

325
00:23:53,408 --> 00:23:56,035
- At the normal rate.
- My nature or your nature?

326
00:24:04,431 --> 00:24:05,791
Put six tablespoons.

327
00:24:09,105 --> 00:24:12,385
That's why I was wondering
how I became a nice man like this.

328
00:24:23,773 --> 00:24:25,605
Greetings, Greetings.

329
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:26,899
Congratulations.

330
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,832
Our congratulations!
Our congratulations!

331
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,566
Greetings, aunt.

332
00:24:30,633 --> 00:24:33,632
Hello dear, looks
very beautiful.

333
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:36,458
O Golshan, when
will Sonita return?

334
00:24:36,733 --> 00:24:40,232
Back... it is the one who left the
house... it is the one you should return.

335
00:24:40,676 --> 00:24:42,036
What happened?

336
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,775
Do you have an affair or what?

337
00:24:43,867 --> 00:24:45,466
No, no, of course, what is this?

338
00:24:45,993 --> 00:24:48,126
Yes, who may have
an affair with you?

339
00:24:48,169 --> 00:24:49,543
Certainly it is the
relationship Sonita, right?

340
00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:51,842
What do you mean "who may have a
relationship with me"? What is missing me?

341
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:54,986
Sonita is the one you should
say what is missing you, right?

342
00:24:56,033 --> 00:24:57,832
In any case, will you separate?

343
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,943
This is our personal issue,
what is your relationship?

344
00:24:59,967 --> 00:25:01,732
No, if you were
separating, tell me.

345
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,666
That is my cousin,

346
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,875
I will arrange with Sonita.

347
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,032
He is an absolute, innocent,
and desperate man...

348
00:25:08,057 --> 00:25:09,348
And white skin.

349
00:25:10,243 --> 00:25:12,063
And Radib is
much longer than it...

350
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,066
Eat spring coils before you
go, it's very delicious, well?

351
00:25:16,267 --> 00:25:18,232
Come, come, children
...where are you going?

352
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,666
It is not that
length, it is like us...

353
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:24,266
- I am going, man.
- It is delirious, listen...

354
00:25:25,766 --> 00:25:27,776
Ascend to the upper floor
...I will bring you "ninety ml".

355
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,999
Sixty, sixty... thirty,
thirty... Please, please.

356
00:26:10,439 --> 00:26:11,439
Welcome.

357
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:14,372
Welcome.

358
00:26:17,547 --> 00:26:19,414
How does the
training of players go?

359
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,872
I talk to my mother every day.

360
00:26:23,306 --> 00:26:25,372
Yes, he is going well.

361
00:26:27,766 --> 00:26:30,332
Did the couple give some
money on the basement?

362
00:26:30,624 --> 00:26:34,045
- Yes...
- My God, I also gave them, now the amount is double.

363
00:26:34,933 --> 00:26:35,933
Oh, my God.

364
00:26:39,105 --> 00:26:42,599
We didn't meet a week ago, and
you worry about the amount you gave?

365
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,100
Sorry.

366
00:26:53,233 --> 00:26:54,399
How much was it given?

367
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,699
- 2100.
- 2100?

368
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,648
Who gives 2100? I
will go and retrieve it.

369
00:26:59,673 --> 00:27:00,673
Oh my God, wait.

370
00:27:01,782 --> 00:27:02,782
Forget it.

371
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,759
Moreover, you are suspended.

372
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,642
Why do you waste money?

373
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,045
You don't have a
financial problem, right?

374
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,366
No, no problem at all.

375
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:17,975
Even if there is a problem, when
we can talk about problems...

376
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:20,632
What is the problem
that I did not talk about?

377
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,159
About us.

378
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:26,099
- Are we a problem? So
what are we, Golshan?

379
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,900
We are a couple.

380
00:27:29,033 --> 00:27:30,299
We are a couple.

381
00:27:30,767 --> 00:27:32,682
If we are a couple, then
why don't we live together?

382
00:27:32,706 --> 00:27:35,826
If we are a couple, why did you leave
your house and go to your mother's house?

383
00:27:39,267 --> 00:27:42,232
I went before you
asked me to go.

384
00:27:43,034 --> 00:27:44,100
You?

385
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,899
Does a person marry someone
to expel him from the house?

386
00:28:06,376 --> 00:28:09,230
Why can we not be
together Golshan?

387
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,732
I miss you.

388
00:28:15,866 --> 00:28:17,926
Also, what do I want?

389
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,266
I just want Golshan small...

390
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,066
A person with eyes similar
to your eyes completely.

391
00:28:26,588 --> 00:28:27,588
The same hadith again?

392
00:28:29,272 --> 00:28:31,214
I said a hundred times,
I don't want a child.

393
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:33,309
Do you want to quarrel again?

394
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:34,466
When will you quarrel?

395
00:28:35,267 --> 00:28:38,227
- You will leave anyway .. So, do you
say that we should quarrel every day?

396
00:28:40,706 --> 00:28:43,605
One must fight the world
Sonita, who is fighting himself?

397
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,320
If you and I quarrel, whatever the winner
is, it is our relationship that will lose.

398
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:49,707
So any world cup we won
because of our relationship?

399
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,232
We are still not even.

400
00:28:51,433 --> 00:28:53,266
Above all, I caused
you to stop work.

401
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:54,943
I did not stop working
at my own free will.

402
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:56,676
You cannot take care of your work,
and you cannot take care of your home.

403
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,009
Wonderful, wonderful, you took
care of your work perfectly, right?

404
00:28:59,033 --> 00:29:01,776
"I will become an actress, I will become an actress,
I will enter the world of films," what happened?

405
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,466
You are running my
mother's store, right?

406
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,832
I gave up acting
due to marriage.

407
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,832
So, did you ask you
to give up acting?

408
00:29:09,233 --> 00:29:11,473
What is the relationship of
representation with marriage?

409
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,999
It becomes difficult
for girls, Golshan.

410
00:29:14,067 --> 00:29:15,643
This is something
you will not understand.

411
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:16,876
Why? Why will I not understand?

412
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,466
Because you never
understand anyone's view.

413
00:29:19,867 --> 00:29:20,867
Amazing...

414
00:29:21,533 --> 00:29:24,228
If anyone in this world...

415
00:29:24,467 --> 00:29:27,187
Teach you how to understand what
another person says, this is enough.

416
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:31,099
You do not speak, and
do not respond to my calls.

417
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,342
Do not respond to my messages.

418
00:29:33,367 --> 00:29:34,799
Do you know, Golshan, how...

419
00:31:48,467 --> 00:31:50,599
Remember yesterday's
eggs... yes, eggs are.

420
00:31:51,033 --> 00:31:53,999
How do you like it... Advice or
fried... or added to Al -Biriani?

421
00:31:55,867 --> 00:31:58,666
Well guys, today we will start
with some warm -up exercises.

422
00:31:58,933 --> 00:32:01,610
Well, everyone runs
up straight... well?

423
00:32:01,737 --> 00:32:05,270
Sir, my nose a little
crooked, what do I do about it?

424
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,786
Well, the nose is not straight.

425
00:32:13,886 --> 00:32:15,745
Let us all in a straight line.

426
00:32:16,161 --> 00:32:17,951
But... sir.

427
00:32:19,131 --> 00:32:23,494
If the door is
the straight thing,

428
00:32:23,532 --> 00:32:28,066
Do we deviate right or...

429
00:32:28,809 --> 00:32:31,175
Yes, yes, well, well, run
in a straight line, agreed?

430
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,399
Come on, lined up.

431
00:32:32,716 --> 00:32:33,748
Relax your bodies.

432
00:32:35,426 --> 00:32:36,506
Yes, wonderful.

433
00:32:37,567 --> 00:32:39,332
Take a breath from the nose.

434
00:32:39,433 --> 00:32:41,532
And forgive the mouth, well?

435
00:32:41,955 --> 00:32:43,335
Quietly.

436
00:32:43,567 --> 00:32:45,166
- Yes, sir. Right line.

437
00:32:47,158 --> 00:32:48,431
Well guys, wonderful.

438
00:32:48,571 --> 00:32:49,618
Excellent.

439
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,900
Relax your hands.

440
00:32:52,733 --> 00:32:53,733
Wonderful, wonderful.

441
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,732
Very good... keep.

442
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:06,099
Where did they go?

443
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,100
What does this say?

444
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,320
Are you the husband
of the judge's daughter?

445
00:33:39,591 --> 00:33:43,773
I told the provincial judge not
to come to my court without a tie.

446
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:47,065
Court ethics apply to Indian
administrative service officers as well.

447
00:33:47,789 --> 00:33:48,789
Go now.

448
00:33:49,032 --> 00:33:50,098
Greetings, madam...

449
00:33:51,201 --> 00:33:53,121
Madam, I cannot train that team.

450
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,632
Do you want to return to prison?

451
00:33:54,762 --> 00:33:55,876
No, no, feet the lawsuit.

452
00:33:56,082 --> 00:33:57,522
I am ready to pay any fine.

453
00:33:58,339 --> 00:34:01,005
Look, you waste
my time and time.

454
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:02,820
Really, aunt?

455
00:34:04,699 --> 00:34:06,979
- What did you say?
- Maternal aunt..

456
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,899
Because you issued the
ruling as a code, not as a judge.

457
00:34:11,193 --> 00:34:14,592
That is why you sent me to where
your daughter's husband is studying.

458
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,532
You did not punish me.

459
00:34:17,133 --> 00:34:19,613
You have arranged a private
lesson for your daughter's husband.

460
00:34:20,999 --> 00:34:22,852
It made a mistake.

461
00:34:23,538 --> 00:34:24,585
And it must be corrected.

462
00:34:24,993 --> 00:34:26,259
I had to...

463
00:34:26,284 --> 00:34:29,509
I send you to clean the floors in the
emergency department of a government hospital,

464
00:34:29,533 --> 00:34:31,631
Or something like that.

465
00:34:32,405 --> 00:34:35,038
Many people come there,

466
00:34:35,065 --> 00:34:37,745
Because people like you are
driving their cars while they are drunk.

467
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:38,775
Do I send you?

468
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,899
No, no, my lady, the sorry of
my lady, you have misunderstood.

469
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,966
In fact, I love your daughter's
husband so much, he is very nice...

470
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,740
Your daughter's husband
is my daughter's husband...

471
00:34:51,433 --> 00:34:52,833
Your daughter's
husband is great...

472
00:35:08,033 --> 00:35:09,066
Hello?

473
00:35:09,091 --> 00:35:11,188
Sir, we got acceptance.

474
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,532
You got what?

475
00:35:12,557 --> 00:35:15,175
Sir, we got acceptance...
in the national championship.

476
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,346
Because we have a
coach... I mean, we have.

477
00:35:19,476 --> 00:35:23,042
Carter Bage, is this something
you should say at five in the morning?

478
00:35:23,067 --> 00:35:26,321
I'm sorry, I should have
told you earlier, right?

479
00:35:26,533 --> 00:35:27,668
I thought you might be asleep.

480
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:30,609
Because, as you know, a person wakes
up from his sleep is not a good thing.

481
00:35:30,633 --> 00:35:32,332
Well, congratulations...

482
00:35:33,133 --> 00:35:34,966
Thank you, sir ..
- No, thank you.

483
00:35:35,225 --> 00:35:36,691
I see you soon, my coach...

484
00:35:37,405 --> 00:35:40,204
How did you wake
up very early today?

485
00:35:40,303 --> 00:35:44,048
- And why all these lights are illuminated?
- There was a call from Carter Baji.

486
00:35:44,147 --> 00:35:46,779
This team will participate
in the tournament.

487
00:35:46,804 --> 00:35:49,105
They may also win.

488
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,784
Mom, what do I want if
these crazy people win or not?

489
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,292
Why? Why is it
important for you?

490
00:35:54,733 --> 00:35:57,632
You are their coach, they are
your team, they are your players...

491
00:35:58,253 --> 00:36:00,085
Do not go like this
in basketball, mom.

492
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:03,075
Do not go like this
in basketball, son.

493
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,366
How can you say
that? Short tall...

494
00:36:05,404 --> 00:36:07,998
My height is not
short... I am average.

495
00:36:08,023 --> 00:36:10,862
Yes, average in Lajt Nakhir.

496
00:36:11,433 --> 00:36:14,366
But for basketball,
you are short.

497
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:16,542
Such a finger...

498
00:36:16,567 --> 00:36:18,867
The smaller finger that
indicates that you need to urinate.

499
00:36:18,891 --> 00:36:21,351
Yes, what if he was
young, talent exists, right?

500
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,608
- Who saw your talent?
- My coaches saw it.

501
00:36:23,646 --> 00:36:27,379
Hey... your coach was not
even prepared to look at your face.

502
00:36:27,433 --> 00:36:30,266
He did not want to perform a short
player's performance experience.

503
00:36:30,593 --> 00:36:33,859
I cried, begged... I
slapped him on his face.

504
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,958
At that time, just have the
performance experience.

505
00:36:42,044 --> 00:36:43,044
See, son.

506
00:36:43,578 --> 00:36:46,518
There are people who
are different from others.

507
00:36:46,667 --> 00:36:49,832
And they must fight
for a person for them.

508
00:36:51,412 --> 00:36:52,878
I fought for you.

509
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:57,499
You are fighting for them.

510
00:37:05,492 --> 00:37:06,492
O boy.

511
00:37:09,946 --> 00:37:11,645
Turn off the lights
and go to sleep.

512
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,655
I am the one who
pays the electricity bill.

513
00:37:13,767 --> 00:37:15,299
If you bothered you a lot,

514
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:17,478
I will go and stay in a hotel.

515
00:37:19,026 --> 00:37:20,292
Do not say that, son...

516
00:37:21,578 --> 00:37:23,277
It sends hope in my heart.

517
00:37:39,562 --> 00:37:42,533
They all grabbed
the balls... no.

518
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,799
They all grabbed
basketball rollers.

519
00:37:47,367 --> 00:37:48,367
Good.

520
00:37:48,535 --> 00:37:50,922
Now we will train
on payment, well?

521
00:37:50,947 --> 00:37:53,956
One by one, put the
ball in the basket, well?

522
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:55,111
One by one.

523
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,966
- Are you ready, guys?
- Well, sir.

524
00:37:57,991 --> 00:37:58,991
Start.

525
00:38:01,067 --> 00:38:04,632
Oh my God, I said
one by one, right?

526
00:38:04,952 --> 00:38:07,451
- my lord... Yes, Karim
did not throw the ball.

527
00:38:07,867 --> 00:38:08,999
Karim A good boy.

528
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,732
Now Karim will put the ball
in the basket, right Karim?

529
00:38:16,757 --> 00:38:17,757
Yes, sir ..

530
00:38:31,711 --> 00:38:32,944
What are you doing?

531
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,199
Come, take all a
5 -minute break.

532
00:38:39,224 --> 00:38:40,723
Drink some water, calm down...

533
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:44,390
Hargovind

534
00:38:45,096 --> 00:38:46,103
Hargovind

535
00:38:49,233 --> 00:38:50,233
Hargovind

536
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:53,481
- Give me the ball...
- for me...

537
00:38:53,506 --> 00:38:55,335
Give me the ball...

538
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,192
- What are you doing?
- Give me the ball.

539
00:38:57,245 --> 00:38:58,938
Hey, what are you doing?

540
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,520
What is this?

541
00:39:15,143 --> 00:39:16,143
Stop.

542
00:39:20,877 --> 00:39:21,877
Shut up.

543
00:39:22,573 --> 00:39:25,372
Training is canceled,
all go to your homes.

544
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:36,986
Sharma G.

545
00:39:38,221 --> 00:39:40,161
Well, well, I'm fine.

546
00:39:41,072 --> 00:39:42,072
Thanks.

547
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:44,405
Go too, enough for today, well?

548
00:39:44,746 --> 00:39:45,746
Thank you.

549
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:03,466
Hargovind, I know that their
families send them all here,

550
00:40:03,906 --> 00:40:07,105
So they can meet people,
make friends, and spend time.

551
00:40:07,533 --> 00:40:10,166
But we will participate in
a competition, starring...

552
00:40:10,393 --> 00:40:13,792
The championships are not
to spend time, but to win them.

553
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,066
I know you are
smarter than them.

554
00:40:18,133 --> 00:40:19,532
And a much better player.

555
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,566
But you cannot train
on your own all the time.

556
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,040
If you play with the team,

557
00:40:23,067 --> 00:40:25,432
We can win, and we
can defeat everyone.

558
00:40:28,567 --> 00:40:30,366
Do not give up the
team, oh Hargovind.

559
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,996
Sir, coach ..

560
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,207
What is your problem?

561
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:01,352
I have Down syndrome, my
face is different from others.

562
00:41:01,609 --> 00:41:04,308
I find it difficult to read what
is written on the blackboard.

563
00:41:04,499 --> 00:41:07,732
I am thinking that I may
have many diseases.

564
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:09,861
Sometimes I urinate
in bed during sleep.

565
00:41:09,886 --> 00:41:12,466
Two days ago, they also
cut the cable TV subscription.

566
00:41:12,622 --> 00:41:15,108
No, no, what is the problem now?

567
00:41:15,133 --> 00:41:18,066
Now this shoe does not
suit me, what do I do about it?

568
00:41:21,822 --> 00:41:22,822
Instead.

569
00:41:23,043 --> 00:41:25,975
I replace them, but I lost
the bill that the store gave me.

570
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,899
Oh my God, instead
with each other.

571
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:32,953
Put this shoe in that foot
and that shoe in this foot.

572
00:41:32,978 --> 00:41:34,532
Good.

573
00:41:34,818 --> 00:41:35,965
Oh my God, sit and do that.

574
00:42:17,479 --> 00:42:20,253
Sir, the coach, my
feet became fine.

575
00:42:21,433 --> 00:42:23,999
Not the feet, the
shoe... forget.

576
00:42:24,733 --> 00:42:27,632
Because, as you
know, somewhat stupid.

577
00:42:28,166 --> 00:42:31,465
No, no, I did not say that,
when did you say that?

578
00:42:31,546 --> 00:42:37,345
I remember, you called
me With "smart master".

579
00:42:38,244 --> 00:42:41,564
I remember... I remember.

580
00:43:06,776 --> 00:43:11,169
Hargovind should be
involved in playing everywhere.

581
00:43:16,167 --> 00:43:17,499
Hargovind left the team.

582
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,299
What do you mean
by leaving the team?

583
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:29,300
He wakes up every day at four
in the morning and goes to work...

584
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:23,576
We had only one good
player, and now who will play?

585
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,893
The rest of the team will play.

586
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,467
Oh my God, the rest is useless,
they are not suitable for anything.

587
00:43:27,491 --> 00:43:28,491
Sir, coach.

588
00:43:29,585 --> 00:43:31,284
- Goodbye, sir.
- Farewell.

589
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:33,999
See... see there.

590
00:43:35,036 --> 00:43:36,943
Sir, he is not a man, he is
like a drunk person at a party.

591
00:43:36,967 --> 00:43:38,643
His hands go in a direction,
and put him in another direction.

592
00:43:38,667 --> 00:43:40,632
No consistency, no
rhythm, nothing...

593
00:43:45,133 --> 00:43:46,632
Where does that
crazy go to his bike?

594
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,872
Oh my God, to stop it.

595
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:51,394
This man will kill
someone today... hey, hey.

596
00:43:53,556 --> 00:43:54,556
He left.

597
00:43:55,033 --> 00:43:57,466
That "useless" has not
caused any accident to this day.

598
00:43:58,567 --> 00:43:59,666
Did you do?

599
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,866
It may be difficult to control
the ball, but self -control is not.

600
00:44:08,767 --> 00:44:10,566
He lives in a hostel
away from his family.

601
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,399
It works in the
kitchen of Absara.

602
00:44:26,867 --> 00:44:29,799
- What to do, man,
faster. Sorry, sir.

603
00:44:29,824 --> 00:44:31,945
"I am faster, I apologize.

604
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:35,377
The Raju family has a shed, spending
his whole day speaking to the plants.

605
00:44:35,402 --> 00:44:39,889
O stubborn aloe vera, other than your
nature, why do you drink all this water?

606
00:44:40,853 --> 00:44:42,208
Hey, Raju.

607
00:44:42,233 --> 00:44:43,832
A wide smile, oh Raju...

608
00:44:44,533 --> 00:44:48,133
Although Raju was born in Delhi, his style
is completely similar to the style of air.

609
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,432
- Goodbye, sir.
- Farewell.

610
00:44:53,026 --> 00:44:55,258
Oh Baji, how are you?

611
00:44:56,543 --> 00:44:58,443
Goodbye, my children, did
you think your nails or not?

612
00:44:58,467 --> 00:44:59,809
- Yes, yes.
- How did you tell her?

613
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:01,199
- Thus.
- No.

614
00:45:01,267 --> 00:45:02,699
- good.. Do not
cut it like this.

615
00:45:02,767 --> 00:45:04,687
- Well, sorry.
- Well, go, goodbye... wonderful.

616
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,760
Is everything well, sir?
- Everything is fine.

617
00:45:07,707 --> 00:45:10,239
Satber mechanic
in his uncle garage.

618
00:45:11,117 --> 00:45:12,304
Not any mechanic.

619
00:45:12,758 --> 00:45:13,972
It is very talented.

620
00:45:14,693 --> 00:45:15,725
This is "useless"...

621
00:45:15,757 --> 00:45:18,456
Mechanical engineering
students teach cars.

622
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:22,499
Use ethylene glycol.

623
00:45:22,567 --> 00:45:25,466
Otherwise, this car
will heat excessively.

624
00:45:25,779 --> 00:45:26,779
Yes, write down that.

625
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,500
Goodbye Sharma G.

626
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:30,900
Goodbye Sharma G.

627
00:45:31,633 --> 00:45:33,032
Charma G's mother is dead.

628
00:45:33,215 --> 00:45:35,115
He lives with his
father and uncle.

629
00:45:35,267 --> 00:45:36,499
It is preferred for everyone.

630
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,599
Sharma G.

631
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,808
Yes, I ..

632
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:42,866
This "useless" works in a café.

633
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:46,796
If any customer understands
what he says, gets a 10%discount.

634
00:45:49,086 --> 00:45:50,432
Thank you Sharma G.

635
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:54,999
Old customers understand
it well, I don't know how.

636
00:45:55,024 --> 00:45:56,189
- Truly?
- Yes.

637
00:45:57,732 --> 00:45:59,728
- Goodbye Baji, goodbye to the coach.
- Goodbye Lotus.

638
00:45:59,752 --> 00:46:00,818
Goodbye Lotus.

639
00:46:01,712 --> 00:46:03,178
Lotus works in a dyeing factory.

640
00:46:05,785 --> 00:46:08,671
- Sir, this leaks?
- Truly?

641
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,399
Keep it, son. Thank
you, sir... Thank you.

642
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:15,953
That is why it comes
every day as a yellow bird.

643
00:46:19,667 --> 00:46:21,132
Gudo loves animals a lot.

644
00:46:21,799 --> 00:46:23,765
And animals likelihood.

645
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:31,858
He works on an animal
farm, he is an animal expert.

646
00:46:32,233 --> 00:46:35,999
This "useless" takes care of animals
that no one else can take care of.

647
00:46:38,153 --> 00:46:40,119
It is always with animals.

648
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,499
Really, is this reason that
the bad smell is emitted from it?

649
00:46:43,605 --> 00:46:46,105
No, no, this is because
it does not bathe.

650
00:46:46,567 --> 00:46:48,799
- I will hold it and bath it one day.
- No no.

651
00:46:49,694 --> 00:46:51,774
When he was a child, he
almost drowned and was saved.

652
00:46:51,827 --> 00:46:53,176
For this reason he
is afraid of water.

653
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,466
The problem is not
water, the problem is fear.

654
00:46:57,507 --> 00:46:59,273
Sir, do I suffer from a fever?

655
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,300
Let me see.

656
00:47:01,933 --> 00:47:03,894
No.

657
00:47:04,352 --> 00:47:06,318
Oh my God, this
cannot be true, sir.

658
00:47:06,763 --> 00:47:08,213
Sir, do I suffer from a fever?

659
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,600
No.

660
00:47:11,667 --> 00:47:14,399
It's okay, I will
fulfill myself.

661
00:47:21,606 --> 00:47:22,587
Oh, my God...

662
00:47:22,612 --> 00:47:27,366
Why is the journey of Delhi
- Mumbai is very late, sir?

663
00:47:27,433 --> 00:47:30,666
How India will become a
great power, I will go and see.

664
00:47:31,106 --> 00:47:32,975
Not that, everything is normal.

665
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,232
Natural.

666
00:47:37,155 --> 00:47:38,175
Natural?

667
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:41,908
My God, many people feel that they
have this or that disease... Sonel too.

668
00:47:41,933 --> 00:47:42,973
I am not talking about it.

669
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,466
Seeing a plane in the
sky and checking its timing.

670
00:47:45,491 --> 00:47:46,990
This is madness, right, Baji?

671
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:48,623
Is looking at a mad plane?

672
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:51,133
Yes...

673
00:47:52,713 --> 00:47:55,212
Many people hide
behind the trees...

674
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:58,821
And they monitor the birds with an endoscope
for hours, calling them "bird monitors".

675
00:47:59,147 --> 00:48:00,387
Why don't they call them crazy?

676
00:48:00,709 --> 00:48:03,575
Some people collect stamps
and stick them in a notebook.

677
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,866
And they stare for hours.

678
00:48:04,891 --> 00:48:07,723
Why do they not call them
crazy, but rather call them stamps.

679
00:48:10,833 --> 00:48:12,999
Each person has his own
nature, their own passion.

680
00:48:17,041 --> 00:48:18,674
Everyone has a story.

681
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,299
Some did not develop
properly during pregnancy...

682
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,399
Others suffered
complications at birth...

683
00:48:24,975 --> 00:48:27,808
Our destiny is not in
the lines of our palm, sir,

684
00:48:28,106 --> 00:48:29,739
Rather, it is written
in our chromosomes.

685
00:48:29,872 --> 00:48:30,872
What does that mean?

686
00:48:31,433 --> 00:48:35,469
It means that the body has cells, and in
each cell there are 23 pairs of chromosomes.

687
00:48:35,709 --> 00:48:37,575
The color of our
eyes, our hair color...

688
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,040
Our length, all these things are
determined by chromosomes...

689
00:48:40,839 --> 00:48:43,438
In each chromosome, two
characters, such as Seta and Geta.

690
00:48:43,861 --> 00:48:45,434
- A true copy?
- Exactly.

691
00:48:45,876 --> 00:48:48,075
The problem occurs when
there are three instead of two.

692
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:51,697
For example, when there are three
copies of chromosome number 21,

693
00:48:52,217 --> 00:48:53,345
Down syndrome occurs.

694
00:48:55,873 --> 00:48:58,559
I mean, if one
chromosome moved a little...

695
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:00,242
To this event for you, or me.

696
00:49:00,519 --> 00:49:01,551
"Useful"...

697
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:10,180
Then there is autism... and Tourette
syndrome, there is a full spectrum.

698
00:49:10,528 --> 00:49:11,408
How do these things happen?

699
00:49:11,433 --> 00:49:15,362
Sir, the coach, sit with
their families for 10 minutes.

700
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:16,960
They will tell you
better than Google.

701
00:49:18,731 --> 00:49:19,831
What about Hargovind?

702
00:49:20,534 --> 00:49:23,794
What is his problem,
it seems normal?

703
00:49:24,853 --> 00:49:27,146
Even the cold varies
from person to person.

704
00:49:27,797 --> 00:49:29,848
A person has a more running
in the nose, and the last.

705
00:49:29,872 --> 00:49:32,266
Someone sneezes ten times,
and the last hundred times.

706
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,499
Hargovind is better
than others, right,

707
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:40,699
But think about it, it's on the
same train... but in a background.

708
00:49:42,233 --> 00:49:43,332
Invisible autism.

709
00:49:44,632 --> 00:49:45,632
Why left the team?

710
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,066
This is another story.

711
00:49:51,133 --> 00:49:52,413
I will tell you at another time.

712
00:50:27,296 --> 00:50:28,296
Go guys.

713
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:32,401
Wonderful... wonderful, go.

714
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,985
Oh my God, do you miss again?

715
00:50:38,009 --> 00:50:40,391
No, no sir, see, nest a bird.

716
00:52:00,029 --> 00:52:03,062
Panto, why do you
rub your ear all the time?

717
00:52:03,087 --> 00:52:05,957
The time passes
quickly when I do this, sir.

718
00:52:05,982 --> 00:52:07,575
Time passes quickly?

719
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,066
However, you should
stop for some time to do so.

720
00:52:12,724 --> 00:52:14,554
Wonderful Panto, wonderful Godo.

721
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:16,261
Lotus, the knees down...

722
00:52:16,286 --> 00:52:18,451
Sunil... Why don't
you use your right hand?

723
00:52:18,672 --> 00:52:20,508
Tennis facility here
...tennis attachment.

724
00:52:20,533 --> 00:52:22,432
So well, do it with one hand.

725
00:52:22,633 --> 00:52:23,666
Sharma G, great.

726
00:52:23,933 --> 00:52:26,247
Raju, I liked it.

727
00:52:26,272 --> 00:52:27,408
Thank you, sir.

728
00:52:27,529 --> 00:52:30,162
After this, we will train
to pass the ball, well?

729
00:52:30,537 --> 00:52:32,371
How, sir?

730
00:52:32,541 --> 00:52:34,032
I will explain that later.

731
00:52:34,102 --> 00:52:37,135
Oh my God, no...

732
00:53:58,366 --> 00:54:00,951
So guys, tomorrow our
first match. Sorry, sir, sorry.

733
00:54:01,016 --> 00:54:02,107
Come Karim.

734
00:54:02,967 --> 00:54:06,099
Tomorrow, that is, on
Monday... our first match.

735
00:54:06,321 --> 00:54:09,820
The biggest difference in this
match is that we will play on our land.

736
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:11,542
What if the TV crashes at home?

737
00:54:11,567 --> 00:54:14,299
Let it be destroyed, they
cut my cable anyway.

738
00:54:14,324 --> 00:54:16,858
No problem at all...

739
00:54:17,165 --> 00:54:19,062
I mean at home... our land.

740
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:21,905
We will play here, where we
all train every day, our land.

741
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:23,906
Sir, Hargovind is not even here?

742
00:54:24,333 --> 00:54:26,599
Hargovind... Hargovind...

743
00:54:27,233 --> 00:54:29,499
Guodo, do you need a reminder?

744
00:54:30,516 --> 00:54:31,516
Sorry.

745
00:54:32,196 --> 00:54:33,276
Now listen to the strategy.

746
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,466
Good.

747
00:54:34,467 --> 00:54:35,600
There is one important thing.

748
00:54:35,624 --> 00:54:37,856
Each of you has three colors.

749
00:54:37,881 --> 00:54:41,336
- One red, one blue, and the other white sir.
- Yes, correct.

750
00:54:42,104 --> 00:54:45,070
For tomorrow's match,
you will all wear blue, well?

751
00:54:45,217 --> 00:54:47,826
Sir, if I wear blue,
then my mother...

752
00:54:48,426 --> 00:54:49,476
You will not get to know me.

753
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,466
And then, sir, my
love, loves red?

754
00:54:51,651 --> 00:54:53,657
She is a passionate seller.

755
00:54:54,103 --> 00:54:56,944
Sir, I said not
to use this word.

756
00:54:56,997 --> 00:54:59,963
Yes, sir said we do
not use this word.

757
00:54:59,988 --> 00:55:04,008
She is practicing a business,
just like my sir's wife, isn't it sir?

758
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,729
- Hey.
- I will wear red.

759
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:07,882
How to wear red, the other
team is the one who wears red?

760
00:55:07,906 --> 00:55:09,675
So I will play with
the other team.

761
00:55:10,122 --> 00:55:11,421
I will only wear red.

762
00:55:11,446 --> 00:55:12,645
Wear blue...

763
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:14,456
- No, red...
- Shut up.

764
00:55:14,481 --> 00:55:16,145
Hey, shut up.

765
00:55:16,402 --> 00:55:17,775
Shut up, I will wear red.

766
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,499
- I love my mother.
- Shut up.

767
00:55:21,267 --> 00:55:23,099
Shut up.

768
00:55:25,833 --> 00:55:26,833
Shut up.

769
00:55:28,933 --> 00:55:31,278
Tomorrow, everyone wearing
the blue color of the match.

770
00:55:46,933 --> 00:55:49,966
What does Carter Bage,

771
00:55:51,676 --> 00:55:55,308
Despite the presence of all these chairs, who
will come to watch a match on Monday morning?

772
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:57,373
My friend, friends will
come... families will come.

773
00:56:02,555 --> 00:56:04,354
When a child is born
like this in the family,

774
00:56:05,105 --> 00:56:06,385
It must be very
difficult, right?

775
00:56:06,742 --> 00:56:09,341
Yes, of course it is.

776
00:56:10,445 --> 00:56:12,311
But everything
beautiful is difficult.

777
00:56:14,948 --> 00:56:16,588
When a child is born
like this in a house,

778
00:56:17,084 --> 00:56:18,883
How is this beautiful or good?

779
00:56:20,493 --> 00:56:24,659
Sir, the coach, the homes are
completely similar to humans.

780
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:28,132
And like humans, it does
not take time for sheikh.

781
00:56:28,746 --> 00:56:31,779
Children grow up and leave the
house, the sheikh of the house.

782
00:56:31,967 --> 00:56:34,466
Every house needs
a little childhood.

783
00:56:35,333 --> 00:56:38,332
It is true that their
families find it very difficult.

784
00:56:38,667 --> 00:56:40,533
They cannot go on vacation,
they cannot watch a movie.

785
00:56:40,557 --> 00:56:41,923
Sometimes they feel very tired.

786
00:56:43,321 --> 00:56:44,436
But this is also true...

787
00:56:44,899 --> 00:56:46,686
As far as these
children are difficult,

788
00:56:47,454 --> 00:56:48,891
They never call the house old.

789
00:56:52,533 --> 00:56:55,199
Their families and friends
love them very much.

790
00:56:55,994 --> 00:56:57,527
Coach, today is Monday.

791
00:56:58,167 --> 00:56:59,847
Even if it was the
last day in the world ..

792
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:01,966
Everyone will come
to watch the match.

793
00:57:05,743 --> 00:57:06,950
- Baji.
- Yes.

794
00:57:06,974 --> 00:57:08,519
Where do I put it?
- On the left.

795
00:57:25,945 --> 00:57:27,865
Didn't I tell you that
you will wear blue shirts?

796
00:57:27,890 --> 00:57:29,472
No, I said red.

797
00:57:29,567 --> 00:57:31,870
No, no, the coach said.

798
00:57:31,909 --> 00:57:33,075
So why did you come in red?

799
00:57:33,112 --> 00:57:36,011
My mother cannot
distinguish me in blue.

800
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,966
I have color blindness,
which color I wear, sir?

801
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47,632
Everyone in the team
must wear the same color.

802
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,999
At least Sharma
G wears blue pants.

803
00:57:52,261 --> 00:57:54,108
Sir, Karim did not come today.

804
00:57:54,224 --> 00:57:56,790
His boss did not give him leave.

805
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:58,523
He is a very bad person ..

806
00:57:59,275 --> 00:58:00,374
I know, but what to do now?

807
00:58:00,399 --> 00:58:01,598
We can wear red.

808
00:58:01,624 --> 00:58:02,624
No.

809
00:58:05,654 --> 00:58:06,654
Judo ..

810
00:58:07,236 --> 00:58:08,236
What is there, sir?

811
00:58:08,378 --> 00:58:10,111
You have two blue shirts, right?

812
00:58:10,519 --> 00:58:12,253
Take off the one inside
and give it to Lotus.

813
00:58:12,277 --> 00:58:14,142
Even if I die, I will
not wear this shirt.

814
00:58:14,239 --> 00:58:16,538
If you want to play, the
Judo shirt is bounced.

815
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
The rest is back to you.

816
00:58:20,886 --> 00:58:24,292
- What about Satper? I
do not have a blue shirt.

817
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:40,756
Hey, pass the ball ..

818
00:58:40,802 --> 00:58:42,968
My mother .. mom,
how are you, mom?

819
00:58:43,367 --> 00:58:47,399
My mom Satbir, look, mom ..

820
00:58:48,253 --> 00:58:49,974
- Come here.
- I?

821
00:58:50,416 --> 00:58:52,338
- I Satbir.
- Yes, I know ..

822
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:55,251
But tell me who made
you wear this shirt?

823
00:58:57,069 --> 00:58:59,835
Satber, go and play
.. Focus on the game.

824
00:58:59,952 --> 00:59:02,982
- I gave him a different shirt to wear.
- Now, defenders, let's defend ..

825
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:07,031
Wonderful wonderful.

826
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:21,375
Hey, genius.

827
00:59:21,443 --> 00:59:22,942
Do not take a month
to wash one dish.

828
00:59:22,967 --> 00:59:24,199
Move your hand quickly.

829
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,299
Will your mother
come to clean the floor?

830
00:59:26,467 --> 00:59:30,066
But my mother died
a long time ago, sir.

831
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,800
How can she come?

832
00:59:34,176 --> 00:59:37,808
Didn't you say that you will
give a holiday for the match?

833
00:59:37,833 --> 00:59:41,066
Yes, and I am the Minister
of Sports .. O small ass.

834
00:59:41,467 --> 00:59:43,899
Really, it is wrong
to pity anyone.

835
00:59:48,033 --> 00:59:51,032
Now, a triangular defense ..
At an angle of 45 degrees, rush.

836
00:59:51,057 --> 00:59:53,338
Defense of the region, rush
...the defense of the region.

837
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:54,556
Take it and take the ball.

838
00:59:54,581 --> 00:59:57,025
Two assortment-one-two guys ..

839
00:59:57,050 --> 00:59:58,358
District defense.

840
00:59:58,568 --> 00:59:59,875
What does the coach say?

841
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:04,075
I do not know what he says, it is necessary
to have something about basketball.

842
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:07,027
Lotus, pass to the
advanced position, faster.

843
01:00:07,052 --> 01:00:08,828
Raju, put a barrier
for the ball holder.

844
01:00:08,858 --> 01:00:10,210
Put a barrier for
the ball holder.

845
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,978
Two assortment-one-two
guys .. Play two-one-two.

846
01:00:13,072 --> 01:00:14,442
District defense.

847
01:00:14,466 --> 01:00:15,575
Wonderful guys.

848
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:18,199
Wonderful basket,
wonderful guys.

849
01:00:18,267 --> 01:00:19,732
Good shot ..

850
01:00:19,757 --> 01:00:21,056
Come on, guys ..

851
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:25,652
Wonderful .. Sharma G, pass
to the advanced center, wonderful.

852
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:31,132
Amazing amazing
.. wonderful guys ..

853
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:37,766
This is a mistake.

854
01:00:39,233 --> 01:00:41,599
This is a mistake, why
doesn't he count a mistake?

855
01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:43,543
O judgment... wrong.

856
01:00:56,772 --> 01:00:58,271
Lotus, pass to Satbir.

857
01:00:58,333 --> 01:01:00,166
- What?
- Quickly, give it to Satper.

858
01:01:03,258 --> 01:01:04,924
Error .. error.

859
01:01:04,949 --> 01:01:07,071
Wonderful .. wonderful.

860
01:01:08,734 --> 01:01:11,261
A free throw to
Satber .. a free throw.

861
01:01:11,821 --> 01:01:13,053
Mistake..

862
01:01:13,567 --> 01:01:15,599
Wonderful Satper.

863
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:21,166
Do not be terrified, focus.

864
01:01:22,426 --> 01:01:27,059
Satber .. This throw
will make us win.

865
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:31,132
It is a very important
throw, do not scare... focus.

866
01:01:31,233 --> 01:01:33,966
Satber .. This throw
is very important.

867
01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:36,775
With this one throw,
we can win the game.

868
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,632
Well, but you are afraid.

869
01:01:38,739 --> 01:01:42,838
Hey, shut up... no one
interferes, Satbir will lose his focus.

870
01:01:43,403 --> 01:01:47,608
Satbir .. Arjun only sees the
eye of the bird, did you understand?

871
01:01:47,699 --> 01:01:49,165
Faster Satber, faster.

872
01:01:49,711 --> 01:01:50,442
He paid it directly.

873
01:01:50,467 --> 01:01:54,942
You are on a side, and the bird's eye is on the other
side .. with that single throw we can win the game.

874
01:01:54,967 --> 01:01:57,560
Fast, Satber, don't be
afraid, keep your focus.

875
01:01:57,585 --> 01:02:00,609
Sir, you are silent first.

876
01:02:06,236 --> 01:02:08,746
Oh, my God!

- Bathe.
- Satper.

887
01:03:44,114 --> 01:03:46,947
Why do you disturb him? You
know that he is afraid to shower, son ..

888
01:03:47,859 --> 01:03:49,738
Judo, come here .. sit with me.

You will not die.

896
01:04:14,053 --> 01:04:15,886
You will be happy when
you enter under the shower.

897
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:19,418
- I will die .. I know.
- Leave this.

898
01:04:20,624 --> 01:04:22,008

Mouse.

907
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:51,199
No, I cannot save it
.. I am afraid of mice.

908
01:04:51,333 --> 01:04:52,699
You love animals, right?

909
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:55,166
You alone can save it.

910
01:04:55,233 --> 01:04:56,732
Look, it asks for your help.

911
01:04:56,757 --> 01:04:59,223

934
01:06:08,543 --> 01:06:10,822
Judo, see where you are?

935
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,966
- In water ..
- Yes, nothing happened to you.

936
01:06:14,067 --> 01:06:15,432
I saved the mouse.

937
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:20,732
Judo ..

938
01:06:21,867 --> 01:06:24,699
Satber, bring soap quickly.

939
01:06:25,767 --> 01:06:26,899
Yes, give me it.

940
01:06:27,033 --> 01:06:31,232
Judo .. Today I overcame
your fear of water completely.

941
01:06:31,533 --> 01:06:34,266
Now take a shower,
come on Judo ..

942
01:07:15,081 --> 01:07:17,014
Hug me ..

943
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:58,808
Parsi .. Parsi ..
Where is Mrs. Parsi?

944
01:07:58,833 --> 01:08:01,532
His name Rustam, kindly
say the name Gupta G.

945
01:08:01,557 --> 01:08:04,089
My name is also Ashok,
madam, did you say it one day?

946
01:08:04,128 --> 01:08:05,869
- Give me two minutes.
- Hey Parsi.

947
01:08:06,045 --> 01:08:07,045
Ashok G.

948
01:08:08,003 --> 01:08:10,008
- What did Rustom do?
- He brought the bus.

949
01:08:10,033 --> 01:08:12,732
So what is the problem, the
whole world comes with a bus?

950
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:18,838
Rustam?

951
01:08:18,863 --> 01:08:22,164
Madam, I made a trailer
from an old bus for rent.

952
01:08:22,373 --> 01:08:24,530
Do you remember my lady, you have done a TV program?
- Yes.

953
01:08:24,554 --> 01:08:26,138
- Only three episodes were filmed.
- Yes..

954
01:08:26,162 --> 01:08:27,358
Two of them failed ..
- Yes, and what is that?

955
01:08:27,382 --> 01:08:29,776
Yes, and what in that, you used the
makeup truck with this itself as well.

956
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:31,499
Yes, but what are
you doing here?

957
01:08:31,571 --> 01:08:33,509
My lady, if she was at home,
my brother would take it.

958
01:08:33,533 --> 01:08:35,132
He drives it quickly,
and breaks it.

959
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:37,566
So I stopped here quietly.

960
01:08:37,933 --> 01:08:39,675
Now this bus will be
stopped here every day.

961
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:41,066
Hey, further vehicle.

962
01:08:41,094 --> 01:08:43,842
What a man, being
Parsi and lives in Delhi.

963
01:08:43,873 --> 01:08:46,021
- Gupta G kindly.
- He is from the people of Delhi as an authenticity of you.

964
01:08:46,045 --> 01:08:47,778
No sentence does not
end without insulting.

965
01:08:47,803 --> 01:08:49,816
- Do I complete the sentence?
- It is not physically.

966
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:50,840
Rustam.

967
01:08:51,305 --> 01:08:52,566
Keep the vehicle, kindly.

968
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:57,432
What hurts your ass, Gupta,
as if there are vehicles here?

969
01:09:02,525 --> 01:09:03,537
What does it mean?

970
01:09:03,562 --> 01:09:05,521
Are you not coming
with us to Chandigar?

971
01:09:08,201 --> 01:09:10,689
Should I and the boys go alone?

972
01:09:10,714 --> 01:09:11,714
How to be alone,

973
01:09:11,972 --> 01:09:13,836
You are with them
.. They are with you.

974
01:09:17,308 --> 01:09:18,818
It is not that difficult, coach.

975
01:09:20,633 --> 01:09:22,299
Can I ask something personal?

976
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:24,166
Yes.

977
01:09:25,267 --> 01:09:26,299
Do you have children?

978
01:09:30,041 --> 01:09:30,575
No.

979
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:34,415
So imagine for one day that
you have 8 children, well?

980
01:09:35,467 --> 01:09:37,588
I have no desire to be a father.

981
01:09:37,613 --> 01:09:38,475
What did you say?

982
01:09:38,567 --> 01:09:41,867
I have no desire to be
a father Kartar Baji.

983
01:09:42,715 --> 01:09:43,714
Sorry, what did you say?

984
01:09:43,739 --> 01:09:45,471
I have no desire to be a father.

985
01:09:47,321 --> 01:09:49,671
My father was not appropriate
to be a father, and I am.

986
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:50,900
Did you understand?

987
01:09:53,168 --> 01:09:54,928
Also, I do not want
these personal questions.

988
01:10:05,538 --> 01:10:06,538
Sorry.

989
01:10:11,866 --> 01:10:13,992
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

990
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:15,750
Hi, sir.

991
01:10:15,981 --> 01:10:17,588
Hello sir.

992
01:10:17,942 --> 01:10:21,136
The coach came
.. The coach came.

993
01:10:22,193 --> 01:10:24,359
Another player is equipped
instead of Hargovind.

994
01:10:25,148 --> 01:10:26,148
From?

995
01:10:27,009 --> 01:10:28,716

996
01:10:28,948 --> 01:10:30,975
- Good.
- Goodbye, coach, congratulations.

997
01:10:31,046 --> 01:10:33,312

- You are shining today.
- Powder.

1002
01:10:41,067 --> 01:10:43,975
He puts a baby
powder, even on his leg.

1003
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,932
Where is the white outfit?

1004
01:10:47,343 --> 01:10:48,408
Here is..

1005
01:10:48,433 --> 01:10:49,433
Hey.

1006
01:10:50,205 --> 01:10:52,559
What do you do Judo?

1007
01:10:53,763 --> 01:10:55,636
Where is that new player?

1008
01:10:55,962 --> 01:10:57,566
- What is his name?
- Golo.

1009
01:10:57,633 --> 01:10:59,666
We played with him last year.

1010
01:10:59,986 --> 01:11:03,618
After that, we all
started to call "the bee".

1011
01:11:03,643 --> 01:11:06,075
- The bee?
- Golo Khan.

1012
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:14,100
Golo .. Golo ..

1013
01:11:18,667 --> 01:11:26,667
Golo .. Golo.

1014
01:11:32,752 --> 01:11:33,785
Are you a girl?

1015
01:11:35,279 --> 01:11:36,345
What kind of fools?

1016
01:11:36,370 --> 01:11:37,999
This is the coach.

1017
01:11:38,146 --> 01:11:39,979
These are, Miss Golo Khan.

1018
01:11:40,867 --> 01:11:41,899
Hi Golo.

1019
01:11:41,967 --> 01:11:45,352
Do not flirt with the saying of
"Golo Golo", Saying Khan.

1020
01:11:48,779 --> 01:11:50,145
Well, sorry.

1021
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,899
Well, but we are
going to play basketball.

1022
01:11:53,433 --> 01:11:55,065
Why did you bring
this surfing board?

1023
01:11:55,609 --> 01:11:56,943
What if there is a
pool at the hotel?

1024
01:11:56,967 --> 01:12:00,945
A hotel, any hotel .. we will return
in the evening after the match.

1025
01:12:01,227 --> 01:12:03,559
Who brought this
negative person?

1026
01:12:03,668 --> 01:12:05,975
- She came to herself.
- The bus arrived.

1027
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,956
Come on, let's come to us,
the bus has arrived, let's come.

1028
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:09,773
What day is it today?

1029
01:12:10,167 --> 01:12:11,167
Saturday.

1030
01:12:26,753 --> 01:12:34,753
Pedro .. Pedro ..

1031
01:12:56,420 --> 01:13:01,700
Pedro .. Pedro ..

1032
01:13:01,725 --> 01:13:04,058
Raju, stop it.

1033
01:13:05,033 --> 01:13:06,499
Stop it.

1034
01:13:07,896 --> 01:13:08,936
Oh, my God..

1035
01:13:13,721 --> 01:13:15,018
Go, go.

1036
01:13:15,043 --> 01:13:16,342
Come on, stand in front of him.

1037
01:13:16,367 --> 01:13:18,164
At least stop it from behind.

1038
01:13:18,484 --> 01:13:19,484
Stop it.

1039
01:13:27,592 --> 01:13:30,625
Yes, yes, take it.

1040
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:32,832
O man.

1041
01:13:37,992 --> 01:13:41,191
Pedro .. Pedro ..

1042
01:13:41,216 --> 01:13:43,779
Where Golo?
- I don't know.

1043
01:13:43,804 --> 01:13:45,366
I don't know.

1044
01:13:48,333 --> 01:13:49,892
Let anyone stop it.

1045
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,099
O comrades, watch
it .. Oh my God.

1046
01:13:58,967 --> 01:14:05,488
Pedro .. Pedro ..

1047
01:14:05,513 --> 01:14:06,342
Where did you go?

1048
01:14:06,367 --> 01:14:08,532
To smoke a cigarette
.. It is forbidden here.

1049
01:14:09,467 --> 01:14:10,866
Dye Pedro... move forward.

1050
01:14:10,967 --> 01:14:12,970
Go, Pedro .. Go.

1051
01:14:13,014 --> 01:14:14,623
Wonderful Pedro .. wonderful.

1052
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:17,841
O man, let one of you
stop this young man.

1053
01:14:17,866 --> 01:14:19,009
I can stop it.

1054
01:14:19,133 --> 01:14:20,232
So stop it.

1055
01:14:20,382 --> 01:14:21,475
A little or complete?

1056
01:14:21,913 --> 01:14:23,646
- Completely.
- Good..

1057
01:14:25,547 --> 01:14:27,435
Table, switching.

1058
01:14:27,867 --> 01:14:29,166
- Go.
- Raju.

1059
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Go.

1060
01:14:36,093 --> 01:14:38,092
Wonderful Pedro .. move forward.

1061
01:14:38,166 --> 01:14:41,848
Go, Pedro .. move forward.

1062
01:14:41,908 --> 01:14:43,308
Is this reason
they call it a fly?

1063
01:14:50,833 --> 01:14:51,833
I stopped it.

1064
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:53,632
It is not a fly, sir, but a bee.

1065
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:54,732
That stings.

1066
01:14:54,839 --> 01:14:57,905
Golo .. Golo ..

1067
01:14:57,930 --> 01:15:01,296
Golo .. Golo ..

1068
01:15:12,367 --> 01:15:14,016
What is this
nonsense against hell?

1069
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:23,807
Sit up.

1070
01:15:25,863 --> 01:15:28,130
Come here, do not
pay attention to that way.

1071
01:15:28,155 --> 01:15:29,989
I don't know what they
are exposed to the young.

1072
01:15:30,013 --> 01:15:32,599
I do not know how to free
people to ride a public bus.

1073
01:15:32,726 --> 01:15:36,470
Don't you have a separate bus?
- Shut up... shut down.

1074
01:15:36,703 --> 01:15:38,603
O team, we played
very well today.

1075
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,659
We will win the next
match by more points.

1076
01:15:40,684 --> 01:15:42,560
Sir, when is the next match?

1077
01:15:45,418 --> 01:15:47,017
What, sir ..

1078
01:15:52,058 --> 01:15:53,098
Is this your girlfriend?

1079
01:15:53,991 --> 01:15:56,157
- No.
- Not possible.

1080
01:15:56,899 --> 01:15:58,498
Did not. Do I look like this?

1081
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:01,820
I am not the worst, but
you are not Salman Khan.

1082
01:16:01,947 --> 01:16:04,354
Never, I am married.

1083
01:16:04,379 --> 01:16:05,379
Who?

1084
01:16:07,431 --> 01:16:09,666
- Sonita. Why didn't you come?

1085
01:16:11,868 --> 01:16:16,208
Cheerlings... a quarrel...

1086
01:16:16,233 --> 01:16:18,190
- A quarrel ..
- Shut up.

1087
01:16:18,215 --> 01:16:20,375
This is what happens
between them.

1088
01:16:20,466 --> 01:16:22,065
- What is happening?
- Sir mine.

1089
01:16:23,929 --> 01:16:24,908
Trains ..

1090
01:16:24,933 --> 01:16:27,173
You act as if you know what
is happening in married life.

1091
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:29,805
- We know.
- We all know.

1092
01:16:30,339 --> 01:16:35,205
Sir, the only thing we do not
know is why people quarrel.

1093
01:16:35,456 --> 01:16:37,955
When the fight
begins, it never ends.

1094
01:16:37,986 --> 01:16:40,485
Yes, even if you quarrel,
why doesn't it end up?

1095
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:44,892
It is not easy
to finish a fight.

1096
01:16:45,001 --> 01:16:46,001
It is easy.

1097
01:16:46,433 --> 01:16:48,432
You do not know how to end it.

1098
01:16:52,061 --> 01:16:53,066
What do you do?

1099
01:16:54,025 --> 01:16:55,432
- Sorry.
- Any sorry?

1100
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:05,624
I saw so it ends, when
you say sorry, it must end.

1101
01:17:10,866 --> 01:17:12,798
Lotus, did not harm, right?

1102
01:17:20,576 --> 01:17:22,475
What do you say, say it clearly.

1103
01:17:26,994 --> 01:17:28,119
What are you saying?

1104
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:30,669
What are you saying?

1105
01:17:32,053 --> 01:17:34,642
My brother, who
is this, take it back.

1106
01:17:34,673 --> 01:17:36,471
- Sharma G.
- Yes.

1107
01:17:51,642 --> 01:17:53,102
What nonsense do you do?

1108
01:17:53,127 --> 01:17:55,513
- Who threw gum?
- Powder ..

1109
01:17:55,538 --> 01:17:58,017
Hey, little actor, shut up.

1110
01:17:58,102 --> 01:17:59,121
Or go down.

1111
01:17:59,146 --> 01:18:02,028
Go down, or I will make
the mouse bite you.

1112
01:18:02,053 --> 01:18:03,988
O mad ass.

1113
01:18:04,073 --> 01:18:06,075
I will take off my
shoes and give you it.

1114
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:08,966
Brother, brother, First,
speak with respect.

1115
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:11,692
Tell them to stop the song.
Why do we stop the song?

1116
01:18:11,797 --> 01:18:12,928
Because this is
forbidden in this bus.

1117
01:18:12,952 --> 01:18:15,019
Smoking is prohibited in
this bus, smoking is forbidden.

1118
01:18:15,043 --> 01:18:17,673
The spit is forbidden, but where is
it written that singing is forbidden?

1119
01:18:17,697 --> 01:18:19,103
Do I show you a full bus map?

1120
01:18:19,128 --> 01:18:20,675
They should have a separate bus.

1121
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:23,666
This is a bus for ordinary
people, not a crazy clinic.

1122
01:18:23,691 --> 01:18:26,143
- Madam, what do you say? Yes,
they are not ordinary people either.

1123
01:18:26,167 --> 01:18:27,784
No, no, do not say that.

1124
01:18:27,831 --> 01:18:31,077
Enemy, but our nature
is slightly different.

1125
01:18:31,102 --> 01:18:33,201
Yes, I will explain, madam ..

1126
01:18:33,233 --> 01:18:35,773
- What is this?
- What a bad man

1127
01:18:35,798 --> 01:18:38,664
No, madam, you are telling
me, I will explain .. What is this?

1128
01:18:38,713 --> 01:18:40,745
Is this how to talk to a woman?

1129
01:18:40,775 --> 01:18:42,714
Brother, what is this insolence?

1130
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:45,399
No, madam, you have to
say that this is part of the body.

1131
01:18:45,424 --> 01:18:46,568
Then I will
explain it correctly.

1132
01:18:46,592 --> 01:18:47,775
What do you explain?

1133
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:50,632
No, no well, forget all of this.

1134
01:18:50,657 --> 01:18:53,294
These poor people won the
match just, and they are happy.

1135
01:18:53,467 --> 01:18:55,209
Where are they bothering?
- Without inconvenience?

1136
01:18:55,233 --> 01:18:56,932
My brother, they
spoiled the entire bus.

1137
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,166
They came with drugs, and they
tried to give it to my son as well.

1138
01:19:00,267 --> 01:19:02,799
It is not a drug, but a powder.

1139
01:19:02,867 --> 01:19:04,699
- Powder.
- If it is powder, put it inside.

1140
01:19:04,724 --> 01:19:07,499
O man, the bus has
become a crazy clinic.

1141
01:19:07,524 --> 01:19:09,818
- Hey, uncle, come here.
- Yes, tell me.

1142
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:13,712
Did your wife escape,
or is she about to escape?

1143
01:19:14,030 --> 01:19:15,297
If you are not crazy,

1144
01:19:15,419 --> 01:19:17,419
To slap you a slap that
leaves a trace on the road.

1145
01:19:26,965 --> 01:19:29,348
End, no problem.

1146
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,466
Sir, the match ...the next when?

1147
01:19:52,563 --> 01:19:53,656
To hell in the match.

1148
01:19:58,568 --> 01:20:00,901
- What about the tournament?
- To hell in the championship.

1149
01:20:06,383 --> 01:20:08,052
Sir, what is this hell?

1150
01:20:31,069 --> 01:20:33,082
- Go ahead.
- I do not eat onions.

1151
01:20:37,643 --> 01:20:39,110
- Hey, Lotus.
- Welcome.

1152
01:20:39,135 --> 01:20:41,534
- Goodbye, sir ..
- Well, goodbye, who came to you?

1153
01:20:41,606 --> 01:20:43,072
- The girl, goodbye, sir.
- Farewell.

1154
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:47,999
- Go ahead.
- I do not eat hot peppers either.

1155
01:20:48,619 --> 01:20:50,218
This is not a hot
pepper, it is a pepper.

1156
01:20:50,242 --> 01:20:52,122
Galaxy is also a
kind of pepper, right?

1157
01:20:52,361 --> 01:20:53,342
I do not eat it.

1158
01:20:53,367 --> 01:20:54,732
Sunil, do we go?

1159
01:20:55,376 --> 01:20:57,408
Sir, my uncle
came .. I am going.

1160
01:20:57,433 --> 01:20:59,041
- Well, okay go.
- I will go.

1161
01:21:00,573 --> 01:21:02,672
- Sunil Wait for a minute.
- Yes.

1162
01:21:02,697 --> 01:21:05,195
Your shoes are a solution,
hold this for a minute.

1163
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:06,220
I am waiting.

1164
01:21:20,079 --> 01:21:22,999
Thank you, sir, for the Lord to bless you .. I am going.
- Good.

1165
01:21:27,576 --> 01:21:30,108
What do you eat, madam?
- I do not eat pepper.

1166
01:21:30,133 --> 01:21:32,999
Do not eat pepper,
do not eat onions.

1167
01:21:34,493 --> 01:21:35,492
- Anything else?
- No.

1168
01:21:35,493 --> 01:21:37,987
- All.
- Thanks..

1169
01:21:38,597 --> 01:21:39,597
Punto?

1170
01:21:40,357 --> 01:21:41,357
Does Judo eat?

1171
01:21:49,477 --> 01:21:50,708
- Please, sir.
- No no.

1172
01:21:50,733 --> 01:21:52,493
Please, sir, it's completely empty.
- You go.

1173
01:22:04,661 --> 01:22:05,661
Sonita ..

1174
01:22:21,333 --> 01:22:25,266
Wait a minute, only four weeks
have passed in my own room.

1175
01:22:26,238 --> 01:22:28,038
Not on my song, son.

1176
01:22:34,933 --> 01:22:35,965
Sonita ..

1177
01:22:37,005 --> 01:22:38,745
Golshan.

1178
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:40,832
- What do you
do? Sorry... sorry.

1179
01:22:42,162 --> 01:22:44,295
- What happened to your nose?
- You just hit him.

1180
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,653
No, no, what did you do before?

1181
01:22:50,433 --> 01:22:51,433
He was injured.

1182
01:22:53,467 --> 01:22:55,275
Have you shocked again?

1183
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:56,432
No, my dear.

1184
01:22:57,333 --> 01:22:58,493
Kindly extinguish this music.

1185
01:23:01,181 --> 01:23:02,527
How does the team play?

1186
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:05,108
- Win two games.
When is the next match?

1187
01:23:05,133 --> 01:23:06,732
I came to talk about that ..

1188
01:23:06,806 --> 01:23:09,605
Please remove this .. I
cannot take care of this team.

1189
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:12,432
I cannot take care of
these 30 -year -old children.

1190
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:14,942
You cannot even take
care of a sixth child.

1191
01:23:15,009 --> 01:23:16,808
Who, your cousin's children?

1192
01:23:16,999 --> 01:23:18,919
Please, these are not
children, but young demons.

1193
01:23:18,943 --> 01:23:21,542
Is this reason you imprisoned
the little in the bathroom?

1194
01:23:21,567 --> 01:23:24,466
My God, he was spending his need
and the door is open, what should I do?

1195
01:23:24,567 --> 01:23:27,899
Three years have passed, and even today,
the sister Benke did not even talk to me.

1196
01:23:28,906 --> 01:23:30,271
You should thank me.

1197
01:23:31,574 --> 01:23:34,015
As you were a good intimate friend,
you are now a strange husband.

1198
01:23:34,039 --> 01:23:35,639
All intimate friends
are good, of course.

1199
01:23:35,868 --> 01:23:37,927
Why? Because they do
not bear any responsibility.

1200
01:23:38,533 --> 01:23:39,666
Responsible?

1201
01:23:40,733 --> 01:23:43,742
You did not carry a
gas cylinder in your life.

1202
01:23:43,967 --> 01:23:45,727
And you talk about
assuming responsibilities.

1203
01:23:46,133 --> 01:23:50,132
O Golshan, one day everyone
should assume responsibilities.

1204
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:53,732
This team gives you an
opportunity to be responsible, man.

1205
01:23:53,807 --> 01:23:55,301
But I train them, my dear ..

1206
01:23:55,733 --> 01:23:58,453
I am their coach and not their
father, to run behind them everywhere.

1207
01:23:58,735 --> 01:24:00,148
You are not the
father of anyone.

1208
01:24:02,776 --> 01:24:04,775
Your father left you and left.

1209
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:07,832
So you think that all
parents will do that.

1210
01:24:08,934 --> 01:24:11,521
You make fun of your mother
because she is afraid of darkness.

1211
01:24:11,967 --> 01:24:14,032
Mocked me because I
am afraid of the lizards.

1212
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:17,383
But the most cowardly
is you Golshan.

1213
01:24:17,874 --> 01:24:19,580
You are afraid to
become a father.

1214
01:24:23,433 --> 01:24:24,899
My coming here was wrong.

1215
01:24:25,609 --> 01:24:26,275
I am going.

1216
01:24:26,592 --> 01:24:27,991
Why did you come?

1217
01:24:29,172 --> 01:24:29,938
To ask for help.

1218
01:24:30,047 --> 01:24:31,047
So request it.

1219
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:32,340
I don't want to order anything.

1220
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,299
I made a very big
mistake to come here.

1221
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:35,599
Forgive me, that is enough.

1222
01:24:35,667 --> 01:24:37,443
Once again, you run
away from the conversation.

1223
01:24:37,467 --> 01:24:38,968
Running responsibilities.

1224
01:24:38,993 --> 01:24:41,074
That team is your
responsibility, that's all.

1225
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:44,776
So, do you say that it became like Sharman Kumar
and carried them on my shoulder here and there?

1226
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:47,349
The matches are in different places,
sometimes here and sometimes there.

1227
01:24:47,373 --> 01:24:50,966
I will not sit with this team
on a public bus or train.

1228
01:24:50,991 --> 01:24:51,460
Good.

1229
01:24:51,903 --> 01:24:54,056
- So he rented a small bus.
- There is no budget.

1230
01:24:54,081 --> 01:24:56,069
I will find a small
bus for you, let's go.

1231
01:24:56,094 --> 01:24:58,369
Really, then who will lead
it? My license has gone.

1232
01:24:58,537 --> 01:24:59,977
My team does not have licenses.

1233
01:25:01,233 --> 01:25:03,932
Do something, since you
feel all this love towards them ..

1234
01:25:04,275 --> 01:25:05,975
Bring you the bus,
and protect it yourself.

1235
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:12,266
Truly?

1236
01:25:13,771 --> 01:25:15,712
Why did you come here?

1237
01:25:16,842 --> 01:25:19,336
Do you think I am your driver?

1238
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:21,966
Am I so foolish,
to leave my work ..

1239
01:25:22,046 --> 01:25:23,979
To drive your bus
here and there?

1240
01:25:27,053 --> 01:25:29,746
- No, I mean, let's discuss.
- No no.

1241
01:25:29,817 --> 01:25:31,577
Please, is it big?
- No.

1242
01:25:34,744 --> 01:25:35,837
Thanks.

1243
01:25:39,767 --> 01:25:40,999
Have you heard the sound?

1244
01:25:41,967 --> 01:25:44,949
It seems as if a love
bird screams on the bus.

1245
01:25:44,974 --> 01:25:45,974
Isn't it?

1246
01:25:46,525 --> 01:25:49,708
Madam, deal with the transmission
with caution please, it's very sensitive.

1247
01:25:49,733 --> 01:25:52,765
Madam, do not manage the
steering wheel strongly, sorry .. but ..

1248
01:25:53,267 --> 01:25:57,332
Madam, something else,
do not give her to the master.

1249
01:25:58,467 --> 01:26:00,585
Otherwise, he will do my
car as he does in his car.

1250
01:26:00,758 --> 01:26:02,438
Do we go, brother, what
happens .. Come on.

1251
01:26:03,466 --> 01:26:06,165
I said that as a matter of humor,
I wish you a happy journey.

1252
01:26:06,409 --> 01:26:08,208
Yes, a happy trip
.. Come, comrades.

1253
01:27:01,833 --> 01:27:04,432
Lotus, Lotus ..
Pay attention, focus.

1254
01:28:42,503 --> 01:28:46,435
Our opponent team seems a group
of scum, to strip them of their clothes.

1255
01:28:47,033 --> 01:28:48,699
- No..
- Why?

1256
01:28:48,724 --> 01:28:51,485
We came to win, not to end them.

1257
01:28:52,743 --> 01:28:55,375
One, two, three ..

1258
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:56,932
Cetari ..

1259
01:28:56,957 --> 01:28:58,356
Come on, guys.

1260
01:30:11,334 --> 01:30:15,800
However, the Cetary team
qualified for the semi -finals.

1261
01:30:15,832 --> 01:30:19,169
Wonderful, isn't it, sir, coach?

1262
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:28,966
Today in the semi -finals, the Cetary
team will face its opponent Basket Guru.

1263
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,666
Go ahead Golo, run ..

1264
01:30:33,691 --> 01:30:35,871
Go, Golo, pass it to Sonile.

1265
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,665
The basket, oh Sunil basket.

1266
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:40,559
Amazing.

1267
01:30:42,752 --> 01:30:44,835
Wonderful guys .. Go
back again, return again.

1268
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:50,455
Oh Golo, wonderful Golo Go.

1269
01:30:51,816 --> 01:30:53,851
Lotus .. Lotus.

1270
01:30:59,805 --> 01:31:01,443
Amazing..

1271
01:31:01,468 --> 01:31:03,032
I really did
something wonderful.

1272
01:31:03,057 --> 01:31:05,217
No, my coach's lady is the
one who did something great.

1273
01:31:07,158 --> 01:31:07,808
Welcome?

1274
01:31:07,833 --> 01:31:10,044
Come on, guys
...retreat... retreat.

1275
01:31:11,060 --> 01:31:12,100
Oh, Panto.

1276
01:31:12,967 --> 01:31:15,132
Why clean your ear, go there.

1277
01:31:15,205 --> 01:31:18,308
Wonderful Panto, do
whatever you want, well?

1278
01:31:18,333 --> 01:31:20,332
All you have to
do is enjoy playing.

1279
01:31:20,357 --> 01:31:22,756
Hey Panto, clean your
ear, well, wonderful Panto.

1280
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:25,999
My God, my lady, you are here ..

1281
01:31:26,333 --> 01:31:27,632
I didn't even see you.

1282
01:31:27,965 --> 01:31:29,185
Wonderful, sir, coach.

1283
01:31:37,033 --> 01:31:38,132
Thank you, madam ..

1284
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:44,166
Madam, please sit, let's go.

1285
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:45,766
Hey Panto, move away.

1286
01:31:47,727 --> 01:31:50,993
Take it, oh Sunil .. basket ..

1287
01:31:51,018 --> 01:31:52,298
- Register..
- Wonderful Sonel.

1288
01:31:58,111 --> 01:32:01,672
In the last stage of the match, the
Cetary team advances 12 points.

1289
01:32:11,203 --> 01:32:12,203
Hargovind.

1290
01:32:13,167 --> 01:32:14,432
Good morning, sir.

1291
01:32:14,433 --> 01:32:15,866
I haven't seen you long ago.

1292
01:32:18,790 --> 01:32:22,297
This team and this tournament are
gaining wide popularity on social media.

1293
01:32:22,633 --> 01:32:23,633
As well as this coach.

1294
01:32:25,136 --> 01:32:26,329
This coach is good.

1295
01:32:26,354 --> 01:32:30,830
- I like it.
- One .. two .. three .. Cetary.

1296
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:33,432
The dreaded is a good
coach, but he is as a man ..

1297
01:32:34,233 --> 01:32:35,233
He will learn.

1298
01:32:35,894 --> 01:32:36,959
We train it.

1299
01:32:40,819 --> 01:32:42,151
He has a shortage here.

1300
01:32:43,019 --> 01:32:44,385
This is not true.

1301
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:47,832
But he will learn to live
with this deficiency as well.

1302
01:32:56,467 --> 01:32:59,132
Well, I will go now
.. I see you later.

1303
01:33:00,667 --> 01:33:03,866
Yes, Golo .. Go Golo ..

1304
01:33:08,733 --> 01:33:11,999
With this victory, the Cetary
team qualifies for the final match.

1305
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:36,132
A minute, minute ..

1306
01:33:38,422 --> 01:33:39,422
Hargovind.

1307
01:33:40,233 --> 01:33:41,233
Hargovind.

1308
01:33:43,667 --> 01:33:44,667
Hargovind.

1309
01:33:46,867 --> 01:33:47,867
Hargovind.

1310
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:52,340
The team plays well, it
has reached the finals.

1311
01:33:53,033 --> 01:33:54,532
You are part of the team too ..

1312
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:56,760
You will play in
the finals, right?

1313
01:34:01,486 --> 01:34:04,152
You want this team to win
at any cost, right, sir, coach?

1314
01:34:04,733 --> 01:34:05,733
Yes.

1315
01:34:08,233 --> 01:34:09,532
You are short.

1316
01:34:11,106 --> 01:34:13,539
But you are a great man.

1317
01:34:16,453 --> 01:34:17,485
Thanks.

1318
01:34:17,994 --> 01:34:19,826
But will you play or not?

1319
01:34:20,353 --> 01:34:21,353
Hey Hargovind.

1320
01:34:21,633 --> 01:34:24,266
There is nothing wrong,
sir, coach, continue to try.

1321
01:34:24,667 --> 01:34:26,499
You know anger from a young age.

1322
01:34:26,867 --> 01:34:29,699
If you try to try, also
learn how to convince.

1323
01:34:29,767 --> 01:34:30,799
I am trying.

1324
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:32,732
Please stop him.

1325
01:34:35,054 --> 01:34:36,054
I am talking about you.

1326
01:34:38,667 --> 01:34:40,399
Why can we not
be together again?

1327
01:34:44,858 --> 01:34:45,938
The past few days and me ..

1328
01:34:47,139 --> 01:34:49,505
I was thinking
about talking to you.

1329
01:34:51,214 --> 01:34:52,794
I am thinking of
trying to convince you.

1330
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:54,200
So convinced me.

1331
01:34:56,573 --> 01:34:57,719
Who stops you?

1332
01:34:58,719 --> 01:34:59,719
Vanity.

1333
01:35:00,633 --> 01:35:01,873
He is a friend since childhood.

1334
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:04,099
He became part of me
and will never leave me.

1335
01:35:04,867 --> 01:35:07,899
Oh Sonita, whatever the
length of a man or husband ..

1336
01:35:08,467 --> 01:35:10,027
His arrogance rises
100 feet in the air.

1337
01:35:11,033 --> 01:35:12,033
And I know ..

1338
01:35:12,667 --> 01:35:16,099
I have a lot of wrong
things that you don't like.

1339
01:35:16,567 --> 01:35:19,599
Every time I go out, I
ask for ready -to -eat food.

1340
01:35:19,933 --> 01:35:22,599
I wear athletic shoes with pants,
I have no sense of elegance.

1341
01:35:22,900 --> 01:35:24,899
I do not recognize any
singer except Kumar Sano.

1342
01:35:25,633 --> 01:35:28,899
If anyone is a little
different from me, mock him.

1343
01:35:29,709 --> 01:35:31,008
Now, what do I do?

1344
01:35:31,033 --> 01:35:34,815
This is what I saw and learned from a
young age, and I do the same thing ..

1345
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:36,456
But now I am trying to change.

1346
01:35:38,748 --> 01:35:40,092
At least I understood ..

1347
01:35:40,279 --> 01:35:42,245
That not all you learned
in childhood was true.

1348
01:35:42,967 --> 01:35:46,532
So I try to give
up wrong things.

1349
01:35:48,033 --> 01:35:49,499
And the right things ..

1350
01:35:52,667 --> 01:35:54,199
Hold it 💞

1351
01:35:57,300 --> 01:35:59,899
Hey Sonita, I know we
have become a problem.

1352
01:36:01,633 --> 01:36:03,566
Can we not return
a couple again?

1353
01:36:04,467 --> 01:36:05,467
Please?

1354
01:36:07,267 --> 01:36:08,632
Yes, oh Golshan.

1355
01:36:09,415 --> 01:36:11,922
But I want to be more
than just a couple.

1356
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:15,299
I want a third person
to come to our lives.

1357
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:17,560
Do I take an intimate friend?

1358
01:36:18,933 --> 01:36:21,266
- Golshan stop, I am
talking seriously. Sorry, sorry.

1359
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:24,932
I want to become a
mother, I can't wait more.

1360
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,532
I understand that, but ..

1361
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:31,732
Golshan.

1362
01:36:32,667 --> 01:36:34,766
How long will you
continue to make excuses?

1363
01:36:35,967 --> 01:36:37,966
It is not that easy,
right Sonita?

1364
01:36:38,233 --> 01:36:40,955
At this age we want
to become fathers.

1365
01:36:41,167 --> 01:36:42,332
You also know...

1366
01:36:42,828 --> 01:36:43,932
At this age...

1367
01:36:44,354 --> 01:36:46,914
...There is a very
high possibility to be ..

1368
01:36:46,939 --> 01:36:49,314
What .. what?

1369
01:36:51,953 --> 01:36:55,285
For children to have
Down syndrome, or autism.

1370
01:36:55,931 --> 01:36:57,451
Our children may
be like them, my dear.

1371
01:37:01,367 --> 01:37:02,367
What?

1372
01:37:06,433 --> 01:37:07,999
I am talking
realistically, my dear.

1373
01:37:08,682 --> 01:37:09,682
Hi, sir.

1374
01:37:10,879 --> 01:37:14,213
I also do not want
my child to be ..

1375
01:37:14,474 --> 01:37:16,541
Gay.

1376
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,999
Sorry Sonel, I
did not mean that ..

1377
01:37:21,134 --> 01:37:22,542
I really said that ..

1378
01:37:22,567 --> 01:37:24,732
I .. I said ..

1379
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:28,166
I am not so fool.

1380
01:37:28,191 --> 01:37:33,408
I know that no one wants
to have a child like me.

1381
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,606
They want a healthy child.

1382
01:37:36,041 --> 01:37:39,068
But they want a father like you.

1383
01:37:41,193 --> 01:37:43,959
Sir, the coach, all
you have done so far,

1384
01:37:44,033 --> 01:37:45,666
You want it with
all your heart ..

1385
01:37:45,754 --> 01:37:48,231
On that, I want to tell you
thank you and I am very grateful.

1386
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:32,766
Please, forgive me Sonita

1387
01:38:46,233 --> 01:38:47,753
I was the national
gold medal champion.

1388
01:38:49,193 --> 01:38:50,258
Patriotism?

1389
01:38:51,167 --> 01:38:52,199
Those with special needs.

1390
01:38:52,831 --> 01:38:54,806
I was the captain
of the Delhi team.

1391
01:38:55,426 --> 01:38:56,825
But my medal was robbed of me.

1392
01:38:57,153 --> 01:38:58,153
Why?

1393
01:38:59,112 --> 01:39:00,778
Our coach committed injustice.

1394
01:39:02,293 --> 01:39:04,093
There were two in the team ..

1395
01:39:04,367 --> 01:39:07,966
They had no Down
syndrome and no united.

1396
01:39:08,234 --> 01:39:09,234
They had nothing ..

1397
01:39:09,533 --> 01:39:11,399
They played forged certificates.

1398
01:39:12,865 --> 01:39:14,966
The coach wanted
to win at any cost.

1399
01:39:16,067 --> 01:39:17,566
He did not trust us.

1400
01:39:20,733 --> 01:39:23,032
Since that day, I no
longer trust any coach.

1401
01:39:35,233 --> 01:39:36,566
When I was eight ..

1402
01:39:38,033 --> 01:39:39,732
My father left us and left.

1403
01:39:43,030 --> 01:39:45,043
Since that day, I could
not trust anyone either.

1404
01:39:47,502 --> 01:39:49,262
I always felt that everyone
would abandon me.

1405
01:39:49,875 --> 01:39:51,728
Before someone abandoned me ..

1406
01:39:53,122 --> 01:39:54,936
Do any play ..

1407
01:39:55,672 --> 01:39:56,672
And move away from them.

1408
01:40:02,615 --> 01:40:03,615
I completely tired.

1409
01:40:06,137 --> 01:40:07,210
I was only eight.

1410
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:11,699
But as on that day, today ..

1411
01:40:12,697 --> 01:40:14,103
After that, I never cried.

1412
01:40:14,300 --> 01:40:17,566
Sir, I saw my mother
crying only once in my life.

1413
01:40:18,133 --> 01:40:20,399
When my medal was
taken away from me.

1414
01:40:37,533 --> 01:40:38,533
Ma ..

1415
01:40:40,943 --> 01:40:43,142
My mother .. I know
that you were very sad.

1416
01:40:43,167 --> 01:40:45,127
When the gold medal
was robbed of Hargovind.

1417
01:40:45,152 --> 01:40:47,218
- But sir, coach .. No
Hargovind, let me speak.

1418
01:40:48,333 --> 01:40:51,533
Because one coach was wrong, it does not
mean that all the coaches will be wrong.

1419
01:40:51,887 --> 01:40:53,099
Trust me.

1420
01:40:53,367 --> 01:40:55,366
- Oh my God, but my son I ..
- This stubbornness.

1421
01:40:57,367 --> 01:41:00,432
I see this stubbornness
in my eyes Hargovind.

1422
01:41:00,533 --> 01:41:02,066
Your son is completely
similar to you.

1423
01:41:02,696 --> 01:41:04,129
Give him your approval, mom ..

1424
01:41:04,433 --> 01:41:06,066
We will definitely
return the gold medal.

1425
01:41:06,657 --> 01:41:07,697
I will accept your feet ..

1426
01:41:07,880 --> 01:41:09,676
- My mom..
- Sir, the coach, it is not my mother.

1427
01:41:09,700 --> 01:41:11,509
It is the aunt mangit
from the adjacent house.

1428
01:41:11,533 --> 01:41:12,699
This is my mother.

1429
01:41:19,103 --> 01:41:20,619
Welcome.

1430
01:41:20,733 --> 01:41:22,890
My mother, sorry, my aunt ..

1431
01:41:24,646 --> 01:41:27,078
All you said now,
say it here too.

1432
01:41:34,727 --> 01:41:35,959
Hargovind.

1433
01:41:36,239 --> 01:41:37,742
The coach who cried my mother ..

1434
01:41:38,179 --> 01:41:39,350
He left.

1435
01:41:40,367 --> 01:41:41,732
But the coach who laughed her ..

1436
01:41:42,533 --> 01:41:44,732
Trust it, my dear,
say to him, mom ..

1437
01:41:44,967 --> 01:41:47,066
I tell him to play
a long time ago.

1438
01:41:47,877 --> 01:41:48,864
He does not listen.

1439
01:41:48,900 --> 01:41:50,632
Play again, son, play.

1440
01:41:57,421 --> 01:42:00,842
- I will play, sir.
- Oh my God, this is wonderful.

1441
01:42:00,910 --> 01:42:02,142
Mom, bring some shirt.

1442
01:42:02,167 --> 01:42:03,866
- Good. Now the
gold medal for us.

1443
01:42:03,933 --> 01:42:05,666
Come embrace me, my lord.

1444
01:42:07,100 --> 01:42:08,100
Oh Fahdi.

1445
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:13,455
Hargovind, thank you.

1446
01:42:13,767 --> 01:42:15,099
To trust you.

1447
01:42:16,467 --> 01:42:17,467
Thanks.

1448
01:42:22,467 --> 01:42:23,866
What do you say Carter Baji?

1449
01:42:24,384 --> 01:42:27,238
Our team qualifies for the finals,
yet we will not go to the match?

1450
01:42:27,967 --> 01:42:29,532
The finals in
Mumbai, sir, coach.

1451
01:42:30,097 --> 01:42:31,097
Yes, and what about that?

1452
01:42:31,476 --> 01:42:33,342
This is good, children
will also see the sea.

1453
01:42:33,933 --> 01:42:36,299
The trip by train is very long,
they may not be able to go.

1454
01:42:37,188 --> 01:42:39,508
We do not have a budget for
flying, hotels and such things.

1455
01:42:40,133 --> 01:42:42,066
I did not expect
to reach the final.

1456
01:42:42,267 --> 01:42:45,432
So we spent all the money
that we had on previous matches.

1457
01:42:46,933 --> 01:42:48,062
This is not fair.

1458
01:42:49,773 --> 01:42:50,933
Children's hearts will crash.

1459
01:42:53,033 --> 01:42:54,732
Sir, the coach, to this day.

1460
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:57,066
What they got
according to their desire?

1461
01:42:57,700 --> 01:42:59,132
Nevertheless, they smile.

1462
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:03,299
They know how to be happy.

1463
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,466
We are crying ..

1464
01:43:50,605 --> 01:43:53,387
Wonderful, look
very happy today.

1465
01:43:53,933 --> 01:43:55,832
No, mom, I am sad.

1466
01:43:56,675 --> 01:43:57,702
But you are smiling.

1467
01:43:58,200 --> 01:43:59,299
Sad from the inside.

1468
01:43:59,517 --> 01:44:00,517
Why, what happened?

1469
01:44:00,700 --> 01:44:02,132
No, no, nothing.

1470
01:44:02,279 --> 01:44:03,279
Tell me.

1471
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:05,299
Forget it, nothing.

1472
01:44:28,994 --> 01:44:29,994
Raju.

1473
01:44:40,140 --> 01:44:42,080
- Everything will be fine, well?
- What happened?

1474
01:44:43,306 --> 01:44:44,346
Everything will be fine ..

1475
01:45:27,543 --> 01:45:29,666
I will go outside
for a few days.

1476
01:45:29,733 --> 01:45:31,773
Do not follow the house
or anything in my absence ..

1477
01:45:32,233 --> 01:45:33,299
Where are you going?

1478
01:45:33,533 --> 01:45:35,166
To the Temple of Teachers ..

1479
01:45:35,393 --> 01:45:36,993
- The taxi arrived.
When will you return?

1480
01:45:38,667 --> 01:45:41,232
When one goes to do good,
he does not ask such questions.

1481
01:45:41,307 --> 01:45:43,639
When I will return .. I will
return after a few days.

1482
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,000
My mom...

1483
01:45:47,167 --> 01:45:48,699
What Golshan?

1484
01:45:48,877 --> 01:45:50,863
- The taxi arrived.
- Tell me.

1485
01:45:53,167 --> 01:45:54,266
The taxi arrived.

1486
01:46:01,067 --> 01:46:03,232
Just go out, go now.

1487
01:46:04,733 --> 01:46:05,766
The taxi has arrived.

1488
01:46:06,026 --> 01:46:07,825
The taxi has arrived...

1489
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:09,200
Good.

1490
01:46:11,267 --> 01:46:13,899
- Let's go...
- Come on, let us.

1491
01:46:32,510 --> 01:46:34,876
Sir, a sound was issued from the piston
today .. Did any accident occur, sir?

1492
01:46:34,900 --> 01:46:36,476
Where Sonita?
- I saw signs of scratches, sir.

1493
01:46:36,500 --> 01:46:37,699
- Sonita.
- Here I am.

1494
01:46:42,730 --> 01:46:43,730
What do you want now?

1495
01:46:44,033 --> 01:46:45,166
I want an actress.

1496
01:46:46,759 --> 01:46:47,759
Will I find one?

1497
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:53,599
- Sonita, forgive me on that day...
- I don't care about your apology.

1498
01:46:54,481 --> 01:46:57,142
I just come for the
team, not for you.

1499
01:46:57,167 --> 01:46:58,699
No .. I understand that.

1500
01:46:58,767 --> 01:47:00,666
Let's focus on the work
we came to accomplish.

1501
01:47:03,972 --> 01:47:06,685
It is as follows, sir, we
follow all the laws here.

1502
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:09,700
We play gambling
at the time of Diwali.

1503
01:47:10,373 --> 01:47:12,640
As far as we win, the
money also goes to the police.

1504
01:47:13,167 --> 01:47:15,099
Nothing happens
illegal here, madam.

1505
01:47:15,301 --> 01:47:17,009
We renewed the license
the day before yesterday.

1506
01:47:17,033 --> 01:47:22,037
Likewise, the food inspector prepared
a great report on us, Madam, listen.

1507
01:47:22,423 --> 01:47:25,105
Let me tell you an
order, in all Delhi...

1508
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:27,766
Nobody attends
the signifier of me.

1509
01:47:28,272 --> 01:47:30,905
Now that you come,
let me go and then go.

1510
01:47:35,814 --> 01:47:37,167
Do you know what this is?

1511
01:47:37,806 --> 01:47:38,806
Memory memory.

1512
01:47:39,633 --> 01:47:41,838
It is not a portable
memory, my uncle G.

1513
01:47:42,234 --> 01:47:43,898
- If?
- Guide.

1514
01:47:44,973 --> 01:47:46,905
Evidence of employees.

1515
01:47:48,033 --> 01:47:51,699
You are employing a young
man here Karim Quraishi.

1516
01:47:52,100 --> 01:47:54,406
You hire him with half a salary.

1517
01:47:54,431 --> 01:47:59,044
You make him 12 hours
and you say it's 8 hours.

1518
01:47:59,780 --> 01:48:03,245
Pover, and talk to
him in a bad way.

1519
01:48:04,342 --> 01:48:10,479
This means that a person faces intellectual challenges
that are exposed daily to psychological and physical abuse.

1520
01:48:12,413 --> 01:48:14,479
You will face at
least eight charges.

1521
01:48:14,726 --> 01:48:16,223
At least...

1522
01:48:16,526 --> 01:48:19,634
You will have to meditate for
three years in Tihar prison.

1523
01:48:21,900 --> 01:48:24,001
Also, the signifier of
Makhani, who promises it...

1524
01:48:24,454 --> 01:48:25,574
Nobody promises it like you.

1525
01:48:26,327 --> 01:48:27,667
So, can you bring
two layers here?

1526
01:48:34,289 --> 01:48:36,736
Oh this, what is your name?

1527
01:48:37,770 --> 01:48:38,770
Brother?

1528
01:48:39,333 --> 01:48:41,832
Can we not settle this
matter between us?

1529
01:48:41,858 --> 01:48:44,018
- Do you offer a bribe to the lady?
- No no.

1530
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:45,100
Not bribery.

1531
01:48:45,700 --> 01:48:47,032
Kahwi for children.

1532
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:48,432
Madam for your children...

1533
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:50,766
Hey, not children.

1534
01:48:50,767 --> 01:48:52,699
- Children... no...

1535
01:48:52,767 --> 01:48:54,532
Well, no children...

1536
01:48:54,767 --> 01:48:55,767
Yes.

1537
01:48:57,133 --> 01:48:58,632
Now listen to what
you should do...

1538
01:49:05,667 --> 01:49:08,320
A plane... a plane...

1539
01:49:08,385 --> 01:49:13,239
Where are you going?
- His boss seized tickets and hotel.

1540
01:49:13,282 --> 01:49:15,413
- Yes... wonderful.
I got fifteen days...

1541
01:49:18,367 --> 01:49:21,075
- vacation. Really,
this is very cool.

1542
01:49:21,100 --> 01:49:23,100
Whoever says there are
no good people in the world.

1543
01:49:23,759 --> 01:49:25,899
I will definitely invite you
as well as for your boss.

1544
01:49:25,937 --> 01:49:27,160
Thanks.

1545
01:49:27,184 --> 01:49:28,708
I wish you success

1546
01:49:30,133 --> 01:49:35,008
My sister, can you not
stop this plane on the left?

1547
01:49:35,033 --> 01:49:36,033
Why?

1548
01:49:36,209 --> 01:49:39,308
No, the journey to
Colkata at eight o'clock.

1549
01:49:39,333 --> 01:49:42,847
It can go and collide
with a plane Mumbai.

1550
01:49:44,033 --> 01:49:45,798
- Good... Congratulations.

1551
01:49:50,462 --> 01:49:51,462
Welcome.

1552
01:49:51,859 --> 01:49:53,724
How are you?

1553
01:50:05,267 --> 01:50:06,267
Hargovind.

1554
01:50:09,789 --> 01:50:11,549
It is good that you are
coming to the finals.

1555
01:50:12,646 --> 01:50:13,646
Thanks.

1556
01:50:13,747 --> 01:50:16,926
Frankly, sir, since the
day your wife came...

1557
01:50:18,167 --> 01:50:20,099
I feel the desire
to join the team.

1558
01:50:40,050 --> 01:50:41,176
We got the rooms, comrades.

1559
01:50:42,087 --> 01:50:44,075
Listen, to share the rooms.

1560
01:50:44,179 --> 01:50:45,878
Two people in one room, well?

1561
01:50:46,286 --> 01:50:47,726
- Godo and Satbir.
- Two present.

1562
01:50:48,233 --> 01:50:49,766
So, Lotus and Sonile?

1563
01:50:50,911 --> 01:50:53,171
Hargovind Stay
with Carters Baji.

1564
01:50:53,196 --> 01:50:53,935
Well, sir.

1565
01:50:54,133 --> 01:50:55,332
Sonita, you are staying...

1566
01:50:58,565 --> 01:51:01,524
Sonita while I am in
one room... that's all.

1567
01:51:02,453 --> 01:51:03,685
Please explain.

1568
01:51:04,293 --> 01:51:06,892
Sharma G says you
will stay in his room.

1569
01:51:08,446 --> 01:51:09,446
Sharma J?

1570
01:51:12,645 --> 01:51:15,411
Did you start understanding
what Sharma G says?

1571
01:51:15,436 --> 01:51:18,474
Sharma J.

1572
01:51:19,722 --> 01:51:22,432
Sorry, Sharma G, I
will stay with Gulo.

1573
01:51:22,732 --> 01:51:25,346
I have a lover,
do not try to spin.

1574
01:51:27,172 --> 01:51:29,374
Sharma G, keep you with Karim.

1575
01:51:29,455 --> 01:51:30,455
Raju, Panto...

1576
01:51:30,699 --> 01:51:34,247
This is my room...
Come, to go up to the top.

1577
01:51:34,667 --> 01:51:36,466
Sonita, ascend
them in the elevator.

1578
01:51:36,533 --> 01:51:38,332
I will go up on the
stairs a little... well?

1579
01:51:38,833 --> 01:51:41,199
Sir, sir, pardon, seventh floor.

1580
01:51:41,549 --> 01:51:43,470
Sir, go in the elevator.

1581
01:51:43,495 --> 01:51:45,408
Otherwise, you will hurt you.

1582
01:51:45,433 --> 01:51:46,966
No, no, I will get
some exercises.

1583
01:51:47,046 --> 01:51:50,012
Because Golshan
is afraid of elevators.

1584
01:51:50,436 --> 01:51:52,275
He was stuck once
when he was young.

1585
01:51:52,343 --> 01:51:54,175
Since that day, he does
not use the elevator.

1586
01:51:54,226 --> 01:51:56,575
Look, take them in the elevator.

1587
01:51:56,739 --> 01:51:58,638
I will come from the
stairs, well... goodbye.

1588
01:51:58,753 --> 01:52:02,497
Goodbye, sir... Goodbye, sir...

1589
01:52:02,532 --> 01:52:04,842
- Go, go. Sir, sir.

1590
01:52:04,867 --> 01:52:06,999
There is a snake...

1591
01:52:07,024 --> 01:52:08,223
snake?

1592
01:52:08,248 --> 01:52:09,813
Where?

1593
01:52:09,838 --> 01:52:10,859
Where?

1594
01:52:12,196 --> 01:52:15,142
Oh my God, Golshan,
are you okay?

1595
01:52:15,167 --> 01:52:16,167
Golshan, are you okay?

1596
01:52:17,512 --> 01:52:20,657
Nothing will happen,
it's just an elevator.

1597
01:52:26,043 --> 01:52:28,836
Close your mouths
...the elevator will fall.

1598
01:52:28,861 --> 01:52:29,885
Do not be afraid.

1599
01:52:30,361 --> 01:52:33,185
- Let's go down.
- My God, it is an elevator that can accommodate six people.

1600
01:52:33,209 --> 01:52:35,169
Look, he will not be able
to bear all this weight.

1601
01:52:35,259 --> 01:52:37,653
Sir, it is not good to
describe anyone as the body.

1602
01:52:37,700 --> 01:52:39,342
I did not describe
anyone with the body.

1603
01:52:39,367 --> 01:52:41,442
I said, your saying
'weight' means a debt.

1604
01:52:43,932 --> 01:52:47,790
- My mother... Calm down.

1605
01:52:47,871 --> 01:52:48,871
Click on the alarm bell.

1606
01:52:51,025 --> 01:52:54,448
No, no, close your mouths.

1607
01:52:54,473 --> 01:52:57,476
Click on the emergency bell.

1608
01:52:58,846 --> 01:53:00,078
Sorry, madam.

1609
01:53:00,424 --> 01:53:02,009
I think the elevator is
stuck, madam, a moment...

1610
01:53:02,033 --> 01:53:03,433
There are players inside.
- Related?

1611
01:53:03,653 --> 01:53:05,705
We are about to die.

1612
01:53:05,730 --> 01:53:08,029
Before we die, I will
bid farewell to my love.

1613
01:53:09,367 --> 01:53:12,893
I have an idea... when the
scooter kicks it, it begins to work.

1614
01:53:12,918 --> 01:53:14,398
Yes, and the
elevator will also work.

1615
01:53:14,423 --> 01:53:17,313
So, let us all cry
together, soldiers.

1616
01:53:17,583 --> 01:53:19,397
Let's go...

1617
01:53:26,586 --> 01:53:28,751
No, no, no...

1618
01:53:39,856 --> 01:53:42,650
Oh my God, are you okay?

1619
01:53:44,051 --> 01:53:45,565
Water, water...

1620
01:53:46,628 --> 01:53:50,208
Sir, we are alive here,
nothing happened to you, sir.

1621
01:53:50,239 --> 01:53:52,205
No one dies from
riding the elevator, sir.

1622
01:53:52,631 --> 01:53:54,504
Sir, where were you?

1623
01:53:54,542 --> 01:53:56,760
I was in the elevator.

1624
01:53:57,186 --> 01:53:58,585
You did not die.

1625
01:53:58,866 --> 01:54:00,865
You did not die,
you did not die, sir.

1626
01:54:01,249 --> 01:54:04,220
You have been overwhelmed
by your fear, just like me.

1627
01:54:04,245 --> 01:54:05,213
Yes, sir.

1628
01:54:05,266 --> 01:54:07,365
Yes, I overcame fear.

1629
01:54:17,002 --> 01:54:18,989
I did not come.

1630
01:54:19,430 --> 01:54:20,550
I did not come.

1631
01:54:21,987 --> 01:54:23,334
I am alive.

1632
01:54:25,300 --> 01:54:26,532
I am alive.

1633
01:54:34,833 --> 01:54:38,442
The elevator was
great. Thank you, mom.

1634
01:54:38,467 --> 01:54:40,399
I already installed
the elevator twice.

1635
01:54:40,768 --> 01:54:43,375
My lion cub is my own...

1636
01:54:43,600 --> 01:54:45,499
So, how are you in the retired?

1637
01:54:45,700 --> 01:54:46,932
Wonderful, wonderful.

1638
01:54:47,033 --> 01:54:49,532
Well, my mother, I will
ride the elevator again.

1639
01:54:49,600 --> 01:54:52,566
This time I will shoot
and send it to you, well?

1640
01:54:52,967 --> 01:54:53,999
Allo my mom?

1641
01:54:54,767 --> 01:54:56,066
I don't hear you, Alo?

1642
01:55:00,072 --> 01:55:03,405
- My mother... Alo...
- Alo...

1643
01:55:05,134 --> 01:55:06,988
Here, my son has returned.

1644
01:55:07,149 --> 01:55:10,249
Yes, yes, this is not,
what is your hotel name?

1645
01:55:11,233 --> 01:55:13,066
My mom, are you
not in the retirement?

1646
01:55:13,485 --> 01:55:15,584
Here you have
started shouting again.

1647
01:55:15,609 --> 01:55:17,542
If I am not in the
retired, where will I be?

1648
01:55:17,567 --> 01:55:19,299
Oh my life...

1649
01:55:19,324 --> 01:55:20,810
Alo Golo.

1650
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:33,766
My mom?

1651
01:55:36,413 --> 01:55:37,413
The bathroom...

1652
01:55:37,765 --> 01:55:39,875
- water...
- water...

1653
01:55:48,869 --> 01:55:49,869
brown...

1654
01:56:18,037 --> 01:56:21,442
Hey, did you eat the
signifier here, it's great.

1655
01:56:21,480 --> 01:56:24,312
Mom, is this time to
talk about the signifier?

1656
01:56:25,368 --> 01:56:27,115
How long has this happen?

1657
01:56:28,808 --> 01:56:31,266
How long did this
start Dalaat G?

1658
01:56:37,333 --> 01:56:38,399
Debavali?

1659
01:56:38,733 --> 01:56:41,966
When did you send me a "I
wish you a speedy recovery" card?

1660
01:56:43,786 --> 01:56:46,619
Your leg was injured
during Choti Holly, right?

1661
01:56:48,433 --> 01:56:49,553
Isn't it Golo, am I right?

1662
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,099
Do not talk to me, please.

1663
01:56:53,300 --> 01:56:56,610
My mother, I will never
accept this, I told you.

1664
01:56:57,020 --> 01:57:00,152
Golshan, if your mother
has a lover, in that...

1665
01:57:00,700 --> 01:57:02,801
Do not use this word.

1666
01:57:02,826 --> 01:57:04,766
- Please...
- So what do you call it?

1667
01:57:04,872 --> 01:57:06,442
My daughter, he is right...

1668
01:57:06,467 --> 01:57:07,932
I also don't like this word.

1669
01:57:08,600 --> 01:57:11,766
Say it is a good
friend, a close friend...

1670
01:57:12,039 --> 01:57:14,780
Am I right, Golshan?
- Don't talk to me, please.

1671
01:57:19,850 --> 01:57:20,850
I am waiting.

1672
01:57:25,133 --> 01:57:28,323
- What?
- I must open the panto clouds.

1673
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:29,500
Does he want to urinate?

1674
01:57:30,520 --> 01:57:32,927
- If?
- What if I need it at night?

1675
01:57:39,533 --> 01:57:41,571
Mom, this...

1676
01:57:43,032 --> 01:57:44,431
- What is there?
- Who is this?

1677
01:57:46,612 --> 01:57:47,612
This is my mother.

1678
01:57:47,696 --> 01:57:48,975
Hello son.

1679
01:57:49,093 --> 01:57:51,159
Coach, your father looks great.

1680
01:57:51,315 --> 01:57:52,675
Thank you, son.

1681
01:57:52,700 --> 01:57:55,572
- Hey, this is not my father, Alo...
- Yes, children.

1682
01:57:55,833 --> 01:57:57,106
- Alo.
- Hello son.

1683
01:57:57,131 --> 01:57:58,505
Mom, this is a mistake.

1684
01:57:58,686 --> 01:58:00,646
This is a mistake, I tell
you, this is very wrong.

1685
01:58:02,267 --> 01:58:03,799
I knew you would say this...

1686
01:58:04,333 --> 01:58:05,999
For this reason
I did not tell you.

1687
01:58:06,680 --> 01:58:08,779
You never support your mother...

1688
01:58:09,306 --> 01:58:10,905
And why should I support you?

1689
01:58:11,166 --> 01:58:13,431
Because I always support you.

1690
01:58:14,133 --> 01:58:15,799
I changed the house
for your training.

1691
01:58:15,867 --> 01:58:19,626
I took you to the
competitions on the scooter.

1692
01:58:19,833 --> 01:58:22,666
Have you seen a short
basketball player in your life?

1693
01:58:22,697 --> 01:58:24,840
No, no, I have never
seen it, it's the first.

1694
01:58:24,865 --> 01:58:28,075
His coach was not
even ready to test him.

1695
01:58:28,100 --> 01:58:31,265
I slapped him strongly on
his face, just kissing his test.

1696
01:58:31,758 --> 01:58:33,575
Also, on Tuesday.

1697
01:58:33,600 --> 01:58:36,570
He was not allowed to eat
meat until Tuesday, ask him.

1698
01:58:36,664 --> 01:58:38,654
- Sir, did you do that?
- Yes, and what is that?

1699
01:58:40,367 --> 01:58:43,966
Whether you are right or
wrong, I support you in everything.

1700
01:58:46,427 --> 01:58:47,607
- Why?
- Why?

1701
01:58:49,120 --> 01:58:50,938
Because it is my team.

1702
01:58:51,243 --> 01:58:53,842
Never give up your team.

1703
01:58:53,867 --> 01:58:56,032
Yes, sir, you never
give up your team.

1704
01:58:56,367 --> 01:58:59,699
Golshan, never
give up your team.

1705
01:59:03,249 --> 01:59:04,309
My mom.

1706
01:59:06,133 --> 01:59:08,232
Why are you crying?

1707
01:59:08,941 --> 01:59:09,941
My mom.

1708
01:59:12,433 --> 01:59:15,799
Enough, do not cry... please.

1709
01:59:20,767 --> 01:59:23,383
Never give up your team...
- Oh, move away.

1710
01:59:24,333 --> 01:59:25,333
What?

1711
01:59:28,999 --> 01:59:31,009
Is Panto clouds open?

1712
01:59:31,034 --> 01:59:32,976
- Yes.
- This is the coach's father.

1713
01:59:33,001 --> 01:59:35,242
Hey, not my father, Alo?

1714
01:59:35,267 --> 01:59:38,075
- Alo...
- What happens here?

1715
01:59:38,100 --> 01:59:39,715
- You are very handsome.
Thank you, son...

1716
01:59:39,739 --> 01:59:41,805
Look, why did you
all come to my room?

1717
01:59:41,966 --> 01:59:44,465
- Godo, this is not my father.
- Yes, it's your father.

1718
01:59:44,619 --> 01:59:46,085
Godo, he is not my father.

1719
01:59:46,572 --> 01:59:48,965
- It is not my father.
- Decent.

1720
01:59:49,313 --> 01:59:50,647
Children are very honest.

1721
01:59:51,100 --> 01:59:52,660
They say they are
a picture of the Lord.

1722
01:59:56,473 --> 01:59:59,672
Children said you are handsome.
- Yes, the children admired the new father.

1723
02:00:02,625 --> 02:00:03,845
Goodbye, my son, goodbye.

1724
02:00:04,542 --> 02:00:07,175
Goodbye, my daughter...
Goodbye... Goodbye Golo.

1725
02:00:07,787 --> 02:00:10,074
- Good night, states J.
- Good night and happy dreams, son...

1726
02:00:10,098 --> 02:00:11,984
Enter, enter?

1727
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:15,666
They return to the room itself.

1728
02:00:17,139 --> 02:00:18,338
What is your problem?

1729
02:00:18,467 --> 02:00:20,599
Your mother's life or her lover?

1730
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:24,200
Both of them.

1731
02:00:25,267 --> 02:00:26,066
Golshan.

1732
02:00:26,267 --> 02:00:28,532
Can't the mother enjoy
her own life as well?

1733
02:00:29,233 --> 02:00:30,866
Oh my God, mothers have no life.

1734
02:00:32,122 --> 02:00:33,308
What did you just say?

1735
02:00:33,339 --> 02:00:35,705
Did you say that you
support your mother or not?

1736
02:00:37,267 --> 02:00:38,599
Yes, I said that, but...

1737
02:00:39,067 --> 02:00:40,766
I cannot change overnight.

1738
02:00:41,367 --> 02:00:44,047
It is enough for me to be proud
that I did not suffocate Galaat G.

1739
02:00:44,725 --> 02:00:45,725
Time passes.

1740
02:00:46,767 --> 02:00:48,566
Then tomorrow our final match.

1741
02:00:49,700 --> 02:00:50,980
And above all
this, this problem.

1742
02:00:56,253 --> 02:00:57,261
Just try.

1743
02:01:02,157 --> 02:01:03,999
- Does it succeed, right? Never.

1744
02:01:05,700 --> 02:01:06,699
Come to go on a tour.

1745
02:01:06,724 --> 02:01:09,230
Let's go.

1746
02:01:09,745 --> 02:01:12,342
Let's go up in the elevator,
and let us film a video.

1747
02:01:12,367 --> 02:01:13,367
Good.

1748
02:01:13,867 --> 02:01:16,399
I don't feel the desire to
send him to my mother now.

1749
02:01:22,733 --> 02:01:30,733
Cetary .. Cetary ..

1750
02:01:42,333 --> 02:01:50,333
Cetary .. Cetary ..

1751
02:02:21,606 --> 02:02:23,939
Sir, their name is
the young players.

1752
02:02:24,189 --> 02:02:25,655
But they don't
seem like that, right?

1753
02:02:26,532 --> 02:02:28,885
Don't worry, they
are all average.

1754
02:02:40,272 --> 02:02:43,163
Oh my God, what is the
problem in length .. We must fight.

1755
02:02:45,033 --> 02:02:48,666
Sir, this battle does
not seem friendly.

1756
02:02:48,946 --> 02:02:50,478
Come, let's go home.

1757
02:02:52,633 --> 02:02:56,266
O Sonel, these are
the national chain finals.

1758
02:02:56,800 --> 02:02:58,966
We will win, because we are...

1759
02:02:58,991 --> 02:03:03,656
Cetary .. Cetary ..

1760
02:03:05,307 --> 02:03:08,480
But hear, wear the
helmet tightly today.

1761
02:03:08,505 --> 02:03:10,064
Good.

1762
02:03:16,699 --> 02:03:17,706
Amazing.

1763
02:03:25,500 --> 02:03:26,766
Go and defend.

1764
02:03:37,748 --> 02:03:39,195
Hargovind, wonderful.

1765
02:03:40,318 --> 02:03:42,731
Amazing.

1766
02:03:48,900 --> 02:03:50,599
Stop it, raise your hands.

1767
02:04:06,586 --> 02:04:08,885
Sunil, stop it.

1768
02:04:08,910 --> 02:04:12,442
Sonil, you couldn't stop him.

1769
02:04:12,473 --> 02:04:14,938
Sir, my finger
has been twisting.

1770
02:04:15,005 --> 02:04:18,961
Sunil, this is not the time
of exaggeration in everything.

1771
02:04:19,772 --> 02:04:20,772
Look at this.

1772
02:04:21,622 --> 02:04:23,509
Sunil, you should
go to a doctor.

1773
02:04:23,534 --> 02:04:25,337
- Go out now.
- No, sir.

1774
02:04:25,605 --> 02:04:27,125
The team needs me, sir.

1775
02:04:27,150 --> 02:04:29,463
I am going, I have to go.

1776
02:04:31,653 --> 02:04:32,653
Look at this.

1777
02:04:36,195 --> 02:04:39,269
But after the match ended,
he took him to a doctor.

1778
02:04:39,320 --> 02:04:41,192
So as not to spread infection.

1779
02:04:41,217 --> 02:04:43,512
Otherwise, you will have
to amputate the entire arm.

1780
02:04:51,651 --> 02:04:52,851
Go, Hargovind.

1781
02:05:16,186 --> 02:05:19,532
Wonderful Lotus,
pass it to Golo.

1782
02:05:52,333 --> 02:05:53,532
O group, the time is over.

1783
02:05:53,900 --> 02:05:56,332
Team, come here, comrades.

1784
02:05:58,418 --> 02:06:01,058
O comrades, you understood
what the problem is.

1785
02:06:01,573 --> 02:06:03,543
Nani Khailadi team has
players throughout the stature.

1786
02:06:03,567 --> 02:06:05,632
Our team has short players.

1787
02:06:05,904 --> 02:06:08,945
Now I will show you how
to defeat the long short.

1788
02:06:09,608 --> 02:06:12,615
Make your weakness
your strength.

1789
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,766
It is difficult for young
players like us to jump high.

1790
02:06:16,008 --> 02:06:18,368
But it is difficult for the
long players to bend.

1791
02:06:18,641 --> 02:06:20,832
So from now on,
all high passes...

1792
02:06:20,857 --> 02:06:22,754
Aerobic passes, the
balls sent from the top...

1793
02:06:22,871 --> 02:06:24,608
All are canceled.

1794
02:06:24,633 --> 02:06:26,532
We will pass
everything from below.

1795
02:06:27,067 --> 02:06:28,732
Passes, pass from the bottom.

1796
02:06:28,952 --> 02:06:31,086
Pass the ball with a
bounce, did you understand?

1797
02:06:31,153 --> 02:06:32,375
Yes, sir.

1798
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:36,931
Well, these long
tall exhausted us.

1799
02:06:37,633 --> 02:06:39,166
Now it's the role
of the little finger.

1800
02:06:39,317 --> 02:06:42,630
Come on, comrades,
one, two, three .. Steari.

1801
02:07:00,779 --> 02:07:02,966
Amazing.

1802
02:07:03,950 --> 02:07:04,950
Amazing.

1803
02:07:13,844 --> 02:07:15,051
Amazing.

1804
02:07:21,926 --> 02:07:22,926
Amazing.

1805
02:07:28,143 --> 02:07:30,426
Lotus, pass the ball.

1806
02:07:50,167 --> 02:07:52,399
Wonderful, wonderful.

1807
02:07:52,513 --> 02:07:53,578
Amazing.

1808
02:08:00,358 --> 02:08:02,270
We just tried for two minutes.

1809
02:08:02,306 --> 02:08:03,907
- Two minutes only.
- Yes, coach.

1810
02:08:03,965 --> 02:08:06,098
- I want to give it to everyone.
- Yes, coach.

1811
02:08:06,123 --> 02:08:09,242
- One, two, three ..
- Cetari.

1812
02:08:27,726 --> 02:08:30,736
Come on, guys,
there is nothing wrong.

1813
02:08:44,283 --> 02:08:46,043
Come on, guys... retreat.

1814
02:08:47,825 --> 02:08:49,846
Stop it, raise your hands.

1815
02:09:19,161 --> 02:09:22,595
Go, Hargovind, there
are still 20 seconds.

1816
02:09:22,620 --> 02:09:26,186
We can still win, go.

1817
02:09:27,733 --> 02:09:29,399
Hargovind, pass the ball.

1818
02:09:30,347 --> 02:09:33,042
Cream, to the basket.

1819
02:09:33,093 --> 02:09:35,858
Go Karim .. Go.

1820
02:09:36,447 --> 02:09:38,961
Oh my God, what do
you do Karim .. there.

1821
02:12:11,300 --> 02:12:19,300
Cetary .. Cetary ..

1822
02:12:58,900 --> 02:13:01,501
Golo, we lost.

1823
02:13:01,641 --> 02:13:03,081
We won, sir.

1824
02:13:03,659 --> 02:13:04,642
We lost.

1825
02:13:04,667 --> 02:13:07,032
No, sir, we won second place.

1826
02:13:07,552 --> 02:13:08,851
This is what I mean by loss.

1827
02:13:08,876 --> 02:13:13,891
Sir, my mother says that
two are better than one.

1828
02:13:13,916 --> 02:13:15,515
Two .. two.

1829
02:13:16,465 --> 02:13:18,872
Sir, we enjoyed
...very wonderful.

1830
02:13:19,827 --> 02:13:22,480
We love you, Mr. Golshan.

1831
02:13:23,654 --> 02:13:26,494
Hug me.

1832
02:14:36,297 --> 02:14:37,490
Sonita.

1833
02:14:39,402 --> 02:14:41,042
I am not their coach Sonita.

1834
02:14:41,833 --> 02:14:42,899
They are my coach.

1835
02:14:49,367 --> 02:14:51,432
I always underestimate them.

1836
02:14:51,767 --> 02:14:54,099
But today I realized that
the shortage was really in me.

1837
02:14:56,333 --> 02:14:58,373
They understand the
happiness and sorrows of others.

1838
02:14:58,433 --> 02:15:01,566
While I couldn't even
understand what others say.

1839
02:15:01,700 --> 02:15:03,199
My thinking is only...

1840
02:15:03,267 --> 02:15:04,566
Inspection of anyone else.

1841
02:15:07,352 --> 02:15:09,872
This may be the biggest
defect in the world.

1842
02:15:13,033 --> 02:15:14,466
I underestimated them.

1843
02:15:16,733 --> 02:15:18,399
The heart of one
is very large...

1844
02:15:19,067 --> 02:15:20,632
How can this be
a defect in them?

1845
02:15:45,069 --> 02:15:46,303
I love you Golshan.

1846
02:16:00,012 --> 02:16:01,012
Lotus.

1847
02:16:03,800 --> 02:16:05,566
Six.

1848
02:16:56,802 --> 02:16:58,516
- Welcome.
- Mr. Araora.

1849
02:16:59,055 --> 02:17:00,115
Good morning.

1850
02:17:00,637 --> 02:17:01,730
Yes, Baswan.

1851
02:17:02,300 --> 02:17:05,032
I have seen what extent
did you reach your team.

1852
02:17:06,839 --> 02:17:08,305
I will retire next month.

1853
02:17:09,557 --> 02:17:13,249
You nominated your
name to replace my local.

1854
02:17:14,300 --> 02:17:15,766
The administration agreed.

1855
02:17:17,400 --> 02:17:20,566
As of next month, you are the
coach of the Delhi basketball team.

1856
02:17:22,667 --> 02:17:24,666
Did you nominate my name?

1857
02:17:25,465 --> 02:17:26,465
Golshan Aroura.

1858
02:17:26,800 --> 02:17:28,432
As a man, you are a pig.

1859
02:17:30,133 --> 02:17:32,832
But you are a great coach.

1860
02:17:33,400 --> 02:17:35,799
It seems that the man
has improved a little now.

1861
02:17:36,067 --> 02:17:39,266
Congratulations, coach.

1862
02:17:40,800 --> 02:17:41,932
Thank you, sir.

1863
02:17:44,200 --> 02:17:45,466
Who was this?

1864
02:17:50,562 --> 02:17:52,595
Nothing, go back to sleep.

1865
02:18:12,657 --> 02:18:13,671
What happened?

1866
02:18:28,706 --> 02:18:30,905
Everyone should
go at the end, coach.

1867
02:18:32,133 --> 02:18:33,766
What really matters is...

1868
02:18:33,945 --> 02:18:36,444
How do we face challenges
when it comes at the time.

1869
02:18:36,600 --> 02:18:39,066
I did a great job.

1870
02:18:39,667 --> 02:18:41,799
In fact, your three
months ended.

1871
02:18:42,033 --> 02:18:43,793
However, we kept you
for an additional month.

1872
02:18:43,933 --> 02:18:45,299
Until the championship ends.

1873
02:18:45,467 --> 02:18:46,499
Thank you, coach.

1874
02:18:54,033 --> 02:18:57,473
Children would be very happy if you
met them before you go, do I call them?

1875
02:18:57,500 --> 02:19:00,699
No, no, I .. no need.

1876
02:19:03,333 --> 02:19:06,199
In fact, I'm late, I have to go.

1877
02:19:07,533 --> 02:19:08,799
As you like.

1878
02:19:09,867 --> 02:19:12,199
Tell them goodbye on my behalf.

1879
02:19:14,967 --> 02:19:18,399
Keep the keys to
this cabinet with you.

1880
02:19:19,333 --> 02:19:22,333
The new coach who will replace your
shop has arrived, waiting at the bottom.

1881
02:19:22,500 --> 02:19:23,999
Give it to him.

1882
02:19:24,810 --> 02:19:25,910
Good.

1883
02:19:31,061 --> 02:19:32,161
I will go.

1884
02:19:33,580 --> 02:19:34,580
Good luck.

1885
02:19:57,950 --> 02:19:58,959
These keys...

1886
02:20:01,210 --> 02:20:02,210
Congratulations.

1887
02:20:02,700 --> 02:20:03,700
Thanks.

1888
02:20:04,212 --> 02:20:06,132
I have not met anyone yet.

1889
02:20:06,700 --> 02:20:07,700
How is the team?

1890
02:20:08,171 --> 02:20:09,171
Amazing.

1891
02:20:09,500 --> 02:20:13,332
Initially, it will take
some time to adapt.

1892
02:20:15,426 --> 02:20:17,266
You will not understand
what Mr. Sharma says.

1893
02:20:18,243 --> 02:20:20,843
The cream method in intermittent
conversation will make you mad.

1894
02:20:21,080 --> 02:20:23,600
You will feel that
everyone is strange.

1895
02:20:23,663 --> 02:20:25,023
You will feel like
stuck somewhere.

1896
02:20:26,500 --> 02:20:27,532
But little by little...

1897
02:20:28,291 --> 02:20:30,131
You will start feeling
that everything is fine.

1898
02:20:31,246 --> 02:20:32,879
The actions Godo and Sonil...

1899
02:20:33,700 --> 02:20:35,380
You will start
understanding it in the end.

1900
02:20:38,667 --> 02:20:42,599
Lotus, you will get used to
seeing a new hair color every week.

1901
02:20:44,100 --> 02:20:45,399
Golo...

1902
02:20:46,095 --> 02:20:47,448
Gossip Satber...

1903
02:20:48,500 --> 02:20:49,766
You will start feeling great.

1904
02:20:53,167 --> 02:20:57,566
Just do not make a mistake
that you are smarter than them.

1905
02:20:58,322 --> 02:21:00,205
They are smarter
than me and you.

1906
02:21:01,833 --> 02:21:03,699
When you teach them,

1907
02:21:04,980 --> 02:21:08,379
You will learn much more.

1908
02:21:12,413 --> 02:21:15,545
Also, do not reprimand them.

1909
02:21:15,633 --> 02:21:16,866
They are very sensitive.

1910
02:21:20,309 --> 02:21:22,175
Do not get angry
with anything they do.

1911
02:21:22,200 --> 02:21:23,332
Their hearts are very pure.

1912
02:21:26,900 --> 02:21:27,900
And also...

1913
02:21:31,167 --> 02:21:32,899
When it is time to leave...

1914
02:21:36,644 --> 02:21:38,164
Do not leave without
bid them farewell.

1915
02:22:12,933 --> 02:22:13,933
Hi, sir.

1916
02:22:14,033 --> 02:22:15,799
Hello sir.

1917
02:22:30,867 --> 02:22:32,232
I will leave you all and leave.

1918
02:22:34,967 --> 02:22:35,967
And then...

1919
02:22:38,210 --> 02:22:40,042
We have been together only.

1920
02:22:40,180 --> 02:22:41,579
Sir, are you about to die?

1921
02:22:41,900 --> 02:22:42,799
What?

1922
02:22:42,824 --> 02:22:44,991
Sir, will you die?

1923
02:22:45,717 --> 02:22:47,685
- No.
- So why do you speak like this...

1924
02:22:47,709 --> 02:22:49,472
- Why?
- No no.

1925
02:22:49,511 --> 02:22:51,065
It is about to die.

1926
02:22:51,090 --> 02:22:52,712
It hides the matter.

1927
02:22:52,737 --> 02:22:58,123
The master is about to die.

1928
02:22:58,148 --> 02:22:59,362
Oh my God, shut up.

1929
02:23:02,514 --> 02:23:03,634
Shut up.

1930
02:23:05,097 --> 02:23:06,910
Oh my God, do
not bark like dogs.
